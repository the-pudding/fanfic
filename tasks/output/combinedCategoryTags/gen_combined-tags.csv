they have so many misconceptions about each other and they're getting shattered in this fic,1
there's not much plot for a 33k fic we just sit in their heads for the whole time,1
this happens several years before the scene where crowley asks for holy water,1
and it's canon compliant so yeah...,1
the ending is a bit bittersweet tbh,1
but i hope it provides a nice explanation for their behavior in 1862,1

Yagi Toshinori | All Might is a doting parent,1
but nobody else seems to notice that,1
class 1-a realising that when bkg tells izuku to kill himself he means it in the brotherly way,1
an excuse to write small snippets of brotherly bkdk,1
while everybody else is just confused,1
they're huddled in the corner of the room like,1
'i thought bkg hated deku',1
'he does why',1
'just bcs dekus asleep in his lap rn and idk im getting mixed messages',1

he's not /really/ a villain /technically/,1
more like a kind of jackass antihero with zero morals who happens to be on the hpsc payroll,1
not... legally,1
but like she calls him dad,1
its prob the most wholesome thing in this entire dumpsterfire of gore and angst,1
haha lets just add a little,1
for good measure,1
he starts out bad but then,1
happens so the LoV is good for one (1) thing,1
one for all is the friend that's always down for murder,1

middle child technoblade supremacy,1

He is never in danger of it but he doesn't know that,1
I promise this is cute I know how the tags look but believe me,1

updating to say to read the tags and tws and that I meant it when I said dark Phil guys,1
lost in the baby sauce,1
technically de-aging?,1
but i suck at writing instincts,1
technically tommy is rebound,1
for himself LMAO,1
everything is strictly platonic,1
it's technically not kidnapping,1
tommy was kidnapped FIRST,1
technoblade is just getting him back accidentally,1
Alternate Universe - Dream Swap (Video Blogging RPF),1
C!Dream is a fucking asshole,1
Spread it around,1

Feral tommy,1
Techno is done,1
He wants blood,1
takes place right before the techno vs dream duel,1
alternate title: tommy gives dream a heart attack,1
Sapnap is there for like two seconds,1
Sort of...,1
but like no explicit scenes of it I guess,1
slightly suicidal thoughts,1
only slightllyyyyy I swear,1
Neither of them know what the fuck is going on half the time,1
Technoblade and Tommyinnit are brothers,1
Tommy is just tommy,1
i miss them,1
dream is an asshole who makes tommy suppress his adhd stims,1
INSPIRED BY RACOONINNIT'S EPIC PROMPTS,1
thank you youre a real one for these,1
And minor appearance,1
Luckily Techno saves him,1
Accidental Manipulation,1
character injury,1
If you ignore the kidnapping part,1
But that's like the main plot,1
So don't ignore the kidnapping part,1
Wait thats just another word for kidnapping,1
Hoglin Hybrid TommyInnit (Video Blogging RPF),1
it's kind of a canon shift of like,1
dream smp hasn't quite happened yet,1
tommy ran away when he was 16 to 2b2t,1
and started fighting 'professionally',1
smp earth is like currently a thing i guess? but only loosely,1
it's been 3 years since tommy left and techno has finally come to grab him,1
quackity and dream play sort of minor roles,1
Friendship Emeralds,1
Obsessive Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1
I swear this will have a happy ending,1
Tommy just has to suffer for a bit :(,1
Rapid Adoption,1
is here too because they're poggers,1
canon? i don't know her,1
racooninnit,1
all my homies HATE smp!dream,1
Chat is a bunch of orphans,1
they are chaos incarnate,1
could be continued if you guys ask enough,1
implied starvation,1
dream gets dumped with glue and glitter,1
Written prior to the festival,1
So there are a lot of creative liberties,1
Essentially wanted to run with the idea of ‘Wilbur actually blows it all up’,1
Also weird family dynamics,1
Technoblade is trying his best,1
Possible Jschlatt redemption arc?,1
also yes I spelled it L’manburg.,1
I mean the festival blew up,1
Non-Graphic/Implied Violence,1
That has to be two tags. I've been messing with tags for a while now.,1
The road to the comfort is a long one — but it’s a functioning road nonetheless,1
They are polar bear hybrids your honor,1
sorry babes,1
not really at all though,1
The Void,1
i promise im not a dream apologist,1
c!dream is a fucking scumbag,1
i started writing this in december and i refused to change the plot,1
Dreamon Hunter Toby Smith | Tubbo,1
seriously though if any plot points happened after late december they are not included,1
so i guess this is,1
because you know the whole concept is a character being unaware that another is a person,1
To be clear the dehumanization is temporary,1
Posessive behaviour is not,1
ED being enabling life partners,1
mentioned 2b2t,1
Mentioned SMP Earth,1
TommyInnit was born in a lab,1
Lab Jack Manifold,1
Or hints to it,1
but not right at the start,1
whether he likes it or not,1
which is literally just,1
Wilbur and phil show up at the end,1
morally ambiguous - Freeform,1
but as a speedrun,1
Cryptid Tommyinnit,1
Creepy feral child Tommy,1
Tommy scares the absolute shit out of Technoblade,1
Technoblade just wants to live his quiet retirement life,1
eldritch horror,1
I came up with this concept while in the fricken shower,1
sapnap is there for like five seconds,1
i have favoritism towards Dream and Techno and I'm not ashamed of it,1
Techno: what you got there,1
Tommy while in the middle of sneaking back into his house: a smoothie?,1
Raccooninnit baybeeee,1
Phil gets to be a little feral as a treat,1
He takes one look at Tommy and yoinks him,1
Shrek AU,1
Healing takes time,1
that boy is so traumatized,1
like if he were a real person he would have so many issues,1
he needs big therapy but all he gets is a big hug,1
This IS Going to Go The Way You Think,1
thats not a tag,1
Good Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1
Tommy just grew his wings,1
Post Technoblade's execution,1
Techno comes back from death to find a child that it's suddenly attached to him,1
Congrats on parenthood,1
Phil gets to be the cool uncle,1
Tommy uses we/us pronouns when talking about himself,1
but is mainly referred to using he/him,1
i am both a c!Ranboo and c!Tommy kinnie yes we exist,1
Ranboo deserves better than the shit hes fiven so goddamnit ima write it,1
frienship ended with platonic husband now platonic husbands best friend (?) is my friend,1
Techs trying his best,1
bc sucks to be you but im built different /j,1
working through trauma,1
Am i projecting onto this fic? WHO KNOWS!,1
OOC maybe,1
in like... a good way i swear,1
hes dealing with instinct sauce rn,1
except their friendship is more akin to o!smp beeduo than dsmp!beeduo,1
listening to providence by poor mans poison for the most of these chapters,1
but thats at the end,1
no beta we die like my psych grade,1
Wordcount: Over 10.000,1
In a Platonic Way,1
dream dies but hes the villian so its okay,1

Sad Philza Minecraft,1
Technoblade is Suffering,1
it's soft just read it i suck at summaries,1
its more implied,1
Blanket Permission Statement,1
Platonic Possesive,1

not very graphic but it's there,1
no beta we die like punz,1
Yes this is why he is in character tags,1
I need to complete my PUNZ IS GONE challenge,1
its more hybrid instincts but ao3 tags am I right?,1
not really but kinda?,1
it’s all wholesome I swear,1
I’m sorry Philza enjoyers,1
but it had to be done,1
I once again put Tommy through it,1
but there’s a lot of fluff this time so it’s ok right?,1
For a while. He gets a bit older.,1
I mean basically,1
they're all children,1
IT WAS JUST MEANT TO BE FLUFF DAMN YOU,1
no beta reader we die like my readers do when I don’t update tlyitds,1
by minor I mean incredibly painful but healed by the end of the fic and there’s no stabbing,1
The goverment is corrupt,1
Heroes are Corrupt,1

Tommy is his humanity,1
He's also his accidental son but EHHHH,1
he's super minor though don't worry,1
he's there for like two seconds,1
yes this was partially inspired by Voltron leave me alone,1
Tommy gets adopted by an alternate universe,1
Platonic Beeduo Marriage,1

he does not respect his freedom,1
Bedrockbros bonding time,1

Obligatory: this is about the characters not the cc,1

on his journey to be a warrior,1
Hot Springs & Onsen,1

"He's a dragon of course he's gonna go ""yoink""",1
he sorta gets addicted to being dead,1
