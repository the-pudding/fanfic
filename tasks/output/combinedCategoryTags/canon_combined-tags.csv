Harry Potter is A Functional Adult,2
Harry Potter Has a Good Life,2
harry potter time travels and Gets Shit Done,2
there are two harrys,2
half the tags apply to one and the other half apply to the other,2
he's an independent man who doesn't need hermione in his life,2
(he still kinda does but he gets by fine with out because he's actually competent),2
sirius gets a muggle job to spite his family but ends up loving it,2
he goes to college and everything,2
the potter's have a cat,2
harry gets a snake and james absolutely hates it,2
DID I MENTION HARRY GETS SHIT DONE,2
mans does a years work within two days,2
he gets to the past and says 'what the fuck are you DOING',2
he calls dumbledore's bullshit out on multiple occasions,2
he's not taking Any Shit this time around,2
he is determined to get his way no matter what,2
and guess what,2
it always works,2
dont get your hopes up for a completed story this is just for funsies :'),2
it's the longest thing i've ever written and i'm proud of it but i know it is Subpar,2
harry definitely doesn't have the emotional reactions he should but just pretend they're there,2
this is a lot of dialogue,2
relationships will probably not be developed properly but i am trying my best,2
it will not be a very good romance story but it'll be a story nonetheless so,2
characters will be ooc this cannot be avoided,2
i am incapable of writing a character that is fully in character,2
very fast paced in the first seven chapters,2
i needed to get to a point i was more comfortable writing about,2
like very fast paced tho,2
like i said,2
does a years work in two days,2

there's not much plot for a 33k fic we just sit in their heads for the whole time,1
this happens several years before the scene where crowley asks for holy water,1
and it's canon compliant so yeah...,1
the ending is a bit bittersweet tbh,1
but i hope it provides a nice explanation for their behavior in 1862,1

Age Regression Caregiver Jimmy | Solidarity,1
Age Regression Little Scott | Smajor1995,1
Age Regression Caregiver Scott | Smajor1995,1
(it's more just valuing someone else's life above one's own),1
(they both wanna protect each other),1
(and they both need hugs),1
(hope this helps),1
Post-Last Life,1
not the smp I mean like actual afterlife,1
now that I think about it. this can be read as post-empires if you squint,1
couldn‚Äôt fully commit to fh angst and now it‚Äôs basically just fluff,1
Star - Freeform,1
Jimmy is short because yes,1
the god of stars and champions to be exact,1
jimmy is so mortal,1
and he knows what a bad idea it is to fall in love with a god,1
but really who can blame him?,1
I mean its 3rd life come on what do you expect,1
they're fucking a lot,1
Relationships are listed in approximately decreasing order of importance,1
jimmy/scott is the drop off to secondary imo,1
the ones towards the end are mostly just sexual or off screen,1
basically if you're specifically here for impdubs then this isn't it,1
but if you need to avoid them at all costs (why?) then you can filter this one out,1
Soulmates feel each other's sexy times,1
and decide to experiment with soulmate swapping,1
Good sex and complicated emotion arise,1
copious amounts of sex,1
but the plot is the relationships,1
(it's me so of course it's all emotional plot),1
A lot of interpersonal complexity,1
Messy polyamory but no one is acting in bad faith,1
people pleaser jimmy,1
jimmy doesn't have good boundaries with trying to please other people,1
everything is always consensual and he never regrets anything,1
but he's very very focused on other people,1
joel is an emotional disaster,1
like someone get that boy a therapist,1
Who know what they are doing,1
And he‚Äôs not fucking,1
There‚Äôs some big relationship conflict,1
Praise kink Degradation,1
But like being in the same room and it‚Äôs all on purpose,1
Shifting Power Dynamics,1
There‚Äôs things that are never going to be said,1
But because people decide that it‚Äôs for the best,1
Assume everyone is a vers switch cause they probably are,1
More characters and tag might be added,1
Double Life lasts months not weeks,1
Who cares about death games when you can have really complicated orgies,1
I put a dropdown in the author's notes for relationship details,1
to help guide your decisions if you want to know how much your otp will be vibing,1
or fucking,1
(not gone into extensive detail and no one else is hybrids or whatnot),1
no one is technically cheating but there's some weird stuff happening over in cheating quartet,1
though scott is lonely and confused before there's any comfort,1
Mainly focused on the Empires SMP,1
Other SMPs are past lives,1
also no Double Life here,1
there's a lot of extra empires world building,1
and I take some liberties with the other smps especially origins bc I barely watch it,1
i hope it's ok,1
Past Lifes,1
i have no idea what I‚Äôm doing but I‚Äôm doing something so that‚Äôs good right?,1

beware! if you interpret team rancher as romantic then. he Is cheating on tango. sorry lol,1
in which jimmy decides that he doesn‚Äôt want his fate chosen for him,1
and decides to be a little defiant for once,1
this one is. pretty hard to interpret as platonic. sorry,1
i swear it‚Äôs not,1

kinda squared,1
so............ about recent events,1

it might be better idk,1
christ i have no idea how to tag,1
basically tommy grows up in the nether. the ideal habitat for a human child,1
such a fun setting to write in,1
i guess? but hes not too worried abt it,1

I promise this is cute I know how the tags look but believe me,1

Technoblade and Tommyinnit are brothers,1
Tommy is just tommy,1

If you ignore the kidnapping part,1
But that's like the main plot,1
So don't ignore the kidnapping part,1
Wait thats just another word for kidnapping,1
Hoglin Hybrid TommyInnit (Video Blogging RPF),1
it's kind of a canon shift of like,1
dream smp hasn't quite happened yet,1
tommy ran away when he was 16 to 2b2t,1
and started fighting 'professionally',1
smp earth is like currently a thing i guess? but only loosely,1
it's been 3 years since tommy left and techno has finally come to grab him,1
quackity and dream play sort of minor roles,1
Friendship Emeralds,1
Obsessive Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1

Chat is a bunch of orphans,1
they are chaos incarnate,1
could be continued if you guys ask enough,1
implied starvation,1
dream gets dumped with glue and glitter,1
Written prior to the festival,1
So there are a lot of creative liberties,1
Essentially wanted to run with the idea of ‚ÄòWilbur actually blows it all up‚Äô,1
Also weird family dynamics,1
Technoblade is trying his best,1
Possible Jschlatt redemption arc?,1
also yes I spelled it L‚Äômanburg.,1
I mean the festival blew up,1
Non-Graphic/Implied Violence,1
That has to be two tags. I've been messing with tags for a while now.,1
The road to the comfort is a long one ‚Äî but it‚Äôs a functioning road nonetheless,1
They are polar bear hybrids your honor,1
sorry babes,1
not really at all though,1
i promise im not a dream apologist,1
c!dream is a fucking scumbag,1
i started writing this in december and i refused to change the plot,1
Dreamon Hunter Toby Smith | Tubbo,1
seriously though if any plot points happened after late december they are not included,1
so i guess this is,1
because you know the whole concept is a character being unaware that another is a person,1
To be clear the dehumanization is temporary,1
Posessive behaviour is not,1
ED being enabling life partners,1
mentioned 2b2t,1
Mentioned SMP Earth,1
TommyInnit was born in a lab,1
Lab Jack Manifold,1
Or hints to it,1
but not right at the start,1
whether he likes it or not,1
which is literally just,1
Wilbur and phil show up at the end,1
morally ambiguous - Freeform,1
but as a speedrun,1
Creepy feral child Tommy,1
Tommy scares the absolute shit out of Technoblade,1
Technoblade just wants to live his quiet retirement life,1
eldritch horror,1
I came up with this concept while in the fricken shower,1
sapnap is there for like five seconds,1
i have favoritism towards Dream and Techno and I'm not ashamed of it,1
Techno: what you got there,1
Tommy while in the middle of sneaking back into his house: a smoothie?,1
Raccooninnit baybeeee,1
Off-screen Character Death,1
Phil gets to be a little feral as a treat,1
He takes one look at Tommy and yoinks him,1
Shrek AU,1
Healing takes time,1
that boy is so traumatized,1
like if he were a real person he would have so many issues,1
he needs big therapy but all he gets is a big hug,1
This IS Going to Go The Way You Think,1
thats not a tag,1
Good Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1
Tommy just grew his wings,1
Post Technoblade's execution,1
Techno comes back from death to find a child that it's suddenly attached to him,1
Congrats on parenthood,1
Phil gets to be the cool uncle,1
Tommy uses we/us pronouns when talking about himself,1
but is mainly referred to using he/him,1
i am both a c!Ranboo and c!Tommy kinnie yes we exist,1
Ranboo deserves better than the shit hes fiven so goddamnit ima write it,1
frienship ended with platonic husband now platonic husbands best friend (?) is my friend,1
Techs trying his best,1
bc sucks to be you but im built different /j,1
Am i projecting onto this fic? WHO KNOWS!,1
OOC maybe,1
in like... a good way i swear,1
hes dealing with instinct sauce rn,1
except their friendship is more akin to o!smp beeduo than dsmp!beeduo,1
listening to providence by poor mans poison for the most of these chapters,1
but thats at the end,1
no beta we die like my psych grade,1
In a Platonic Way,1

and arrows,1
Minecraft Mobs,1
realistic minecraft au,1
dream wears his mask but not when he's only around sbi,1

He just works for the heroes,1
TommyInnit Gets a Break (Video Blogging RPF),1

oldest brother techno supremacy,1
everyone takes a nap,1
that's it thats the story,1
Wilbur said:,1
"It really is like I have a little brother (Tommy),1
Techno's my older brother and Phil's our dad",1
And I have not let go of that quote SINCE,1
starting off strong,1
not dark sbi but,1
techno said no sbi family dynamics i say fuck off,1
3/4 SBI im sorry guys not my fault Will's dead,1

tommy thinks stuff is his fault,1
author is a filthy projector,1
im not a doctor but the main medical part of this is based on experience,1
JK i Lied,1

tommy can have a little hypothermia,1
TommyInnit has scars,1
Modded AU,1
Malnourishment,1
Internalized Abuse,1
Tommy is Spiderman,1

Wilbur is a Spiderman enthusiast,1
even more so when he finds out Spiderman is a Child,1
a lot of people make an appearance and trust me - they all know he's Spiderman,1
niki is holding them all together as normal,1
bad is j Jonah Jameson bc I think it's funny,1
okayyy,1
Tommy and Techno seeing each other again after l'manburg just fucking DIES,1
They got a fuckton of issues,1
I'm a Techno apologist,1
And a Tommy apologist,1
Really just the entirely of SBI can do no wrong,1
They literally destroy l'manburg and put it into ashes in this fic,1
and that's a-okay,1
It's just their vibes really,1
Depressed Tommy,1
Self amputation,1
finally Tommy gets help,1
Phil is such a good dad,1
Techno is gonna murder green boy,1
Loosely Follows Canon,1
Angst with a happy ending?,1

The goverment is corrupt,1
Heroes are Corrupt,1

Punching,1
Everyone is in the story,1
everyone is a knight,1
techno is a bro,1
caught kissing,1
the whole palace knows and no one is surprised,1
Ending is chaos,1
Kinda I mean I THINK,1

Hibernating Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1
A lot actually,1
because techno has no idea what gender tommy is at first,1
he's a little gremlin,1
Tommy is a Prime devout and Techno respects that,1
he does not respect his freedom,1
Bedrockbros bonding time,1
conversations about faith,1
Obligatory: this is about the characters not the cc,1
is usually a hero-story thing but please,1
respect Techno's terrible and awkward attempts at remembering how mortals work,1

Dream sucks in this one sorry,1
Tommy is a warrior with plot armor and you know what good for him,1
This is written so dramatically but then again it's midnight,1
So really that's not my fault,1
Based off my thread on twitter of Tommy being watched over by three gods,1
on his journey to be a warrior,1
Make Phil's tag not his name challenge,1
Techno is a Dragon,1
Brotherblade vibes,1
"Tommy is like ""I'm going to kill you!""",1
"and Techno goes ""oh god that's a child""",1
guess I'll adopt you,1
"He's a dragon of course he's gonna go ""yoink""",1
he sorta gets addicted to being dead,1
this one is sad guys,1
Yes I am still giving Tommy emotional support animals what about it,1

this fic is my own little bottle of unhappiness written on a whim based on an idea I had,1
(it's mushroom henry),1
dead brothers can be helpful sometimes,1
but like a lot of hurt before the comfort,1
This will end in crime boys feelings,1
This is about roleplay characters and has nothing to do with the ccs portraying them,1
none of my work should ever be interpreted as ship,1
additional warnings:,1
because exile was an abduction let‚Äôs be clear,1
rated M for violence,1

also this was supposed to be under 5000 words,1
it's more like a curse than a real life illness tho,1
sometimes you're a vampire hunter and end up with a depressed vampire as your roommate,1
the tags make it look sad but I promise this is actually pretty wholesome,1
google what do you do when the vampire you're trying to kill is depressed,1
Phil and Techno are only mentioned,1
literally so much fluff this is tooth rottingly sweet,1
techno and phil are both mentioned but not by name,1

I don't think it's any more graphic that the show is,1
i've been meaning to update the tags,1
Hannibal views Will as precious,1
Precious Will Graham,1

Its weird when you tag a Hannibal fic for swearing,1
But then its weird when you tag a House fic for cannibalistically sadistic mind-manipulation,1
pairings are implied,1
