Harry Potter is A Functional Adult,2
Harry Potter Has a Good Life,2
harry potter time travels and Gets Shit Done,2
there are two harrys,2
half the tags apply to one and the other half apply to the other,2
he's an independent man who doesn't need hermione in his life,2
(he still kinda does but he gets by fine with out because he's actually competent),2
sirius gets a muggle job to spite his family but ends up loving it,2
he goes to college and everything,2
the potter's have a cat,2
harry gets a snake and james absolutely hates it,2
DID I MENTION HARRY GETS SHIT DONE,2
mans does a years work within two days,2
he gets to the past and says 'what the fuck are you DOING',2
he calls dumbledore's bullshit out on multiple occasions,2
he's not taking Any Shit this time around,2
he is determined to get his way no matter what,2
and guess what,2
it always works,2
dont get your hopes up for a completed story this is just for funsies :'),2
it's the longest thing i've ever written and i'm proud of it but i know it is Subpar,2
harry definitely doesn't have the emotional reactions he should but just pretend they're there,2
this is a lot of dialogue,2
relationships will probably not be developed properly but i am trying my best,2
it will not be a very good romance story but it'll be a story nonetheless so,2
characters will be ooc this cannot be avoided,2
i am incapable of writing a character that is fully in character,2
very fast paced in the first seven chapters,2
i needed to get to a point i was more comfortable writing about,2
like very fast paced tho,2
like i said,2
does a years work in two days,2

they all love eachother,2
because they're really minor,2
definitely not kidnapping,2
alright so it's not actually super super dark because wil and phil don't mean to be bad,2
but also they're ancient vampires and kinda behind the times on what 'sus behavior' actually is,2
confession: this was meant to be much darker,2
but i chickened out and so we're gonna have a happy ending,2

Unreliable Narration,1
Hunter's a Trekkie and it's canon and it's the best thing to ever happen to me,1
which means Hunter writes Star Trek fanfic,1
and it's really bad,1
playing fast and loose with canon,1
mostly because the sneak peeks and the promo have dropped while I was writing this,1
if Amity seems too much like her s1 self that's because progress isn't exactly linear,1

Ambiguity,1
canon up until about the end of the 4th season,1
they may be codependant but do not be fooled. Izuku and Katsuki aren't buds,1

its prob the most wholesome thing in this entire dumpsterfire of gore and angst,1

he starts out bad but then,1
happens so the LoV is good for one (1) thing,1

(hope this helps),1
Post-Last Life,1
not the smp I mean like actual afterlife,1
now that I think about it. this can be read as post-empires if you squint,1
couldn’t fully commit to fh angst and now it’s basically just fluff,1
Star - Freeform,1
Jimmy is short because yes,1
the god of stars and champions to be exact,1
jimmy is so mortal,1
and he knows what a bad idea it is to fall in love with a god,1
but really who can blame him?,1
I mean its 3rd life come on what do you expect,1
they're fucking a lot,1
Relationships are listed in approximately decreasing order of importance,1
jimmy/scott is the drop off to secondary imo,1
the ones towards the end are mostly just sexual or off screen,1
basically if you're specifically here for impdubs then this isn't it,1
but if you need to avoid them at all costs (why?) then you can filter this one out,1
Soulmates feel each other's sexy times,1
and decide to experiment with soulmate swapping,1
Good sex and complicated emotion arise,1
copious amounts of sex,1
but the plot is the relationships,1
(it's me so of course it's all emotional plot),1
A lot of interpersonal complexity,1
Messy polyamory but no one is acting in bad faith,1
people pleaser jimmy,1
jimmy doesn't have good boundaries with trying to please other people,1
everything is always consensual and he never regrets anything,1
but he's very very focused on other people,1
joel is an emotional disaster,1
like someone get that boy a therapist,1
Who know what they are doing,1
And he’s not fucking,1
There’s some big relationship conflict,1
Praise kink Degradation,1
But like being in the same room and it’s all on purpose,1
Shifting Power Dynamics,1
There’s things that are never going to be said,1
But because people decide that it’s for the best,1
Assume everyone is a vers switch cause they probably are,1
More characters and tag might be added,1
Double Life lasts months not weeks,1
Who cares about death games when you can have really complicated orgies,1
I put a dropdown in the author's notes for relationship details,1
to help guide your decisions if you want to know how much your otp will be vibing,1
or fucking,1
(not gone into extensive detail and no one else is hybrids or whatnot),1
no one is technically cheating but there's some weird stuff happening over in cheating quartet,1
though scott is lonely and confused before there's any comfort,1
Mainly focused on the Empires SMP,1
Other SMPs are past lives,1
also no Double Life here,1
there's a lot of extra empires world building,1
and I take some liberties with the other smps especially origins bc I barely watch it,1
i hope it's ok,1
Past Lifes,1
i have no idea what I’m doing but I’m doing something so that’s good right?,1

if you're looking for an explanation as to why i wrote this,1
you won't be getting it,1
yeah this was inspired by a tumblr post i saw,1

you'll definitely want to kill Lily and me by the middle of this,1
and I won't even be angry about it because you'll be right to want to kill me,1
also I'm not tagging the smut chapter anymore because I keep combining chapters in edits and fuck it,1
I was advised to tag this heavy angst,1
so I'm tagging it heavy angst,1
but it does have a happy ending I swear,1
I confirmed it on tumblr if you don't believe me,1
people keep asking me because this is so angsty and no one believes,1

does the OT3 have a name yet because if not I propose Jevily,1
Jevily,1
Marauders era (end of 5th through 7th year),1
COMPLICATED CHARACTERS WHO ARE NOT PERFECT AND WHO SOMETIMES MAKE BAD CHOICES,1
Top/bottom versatile James and Severus,1
just FYI there won't be fixed top/bottom dynamics between James and Sev -they will switch,1
this is not a morality fable where characters get punished for their sins,1
James did bad things. Lily did bad things. Sev did bad things. I stan a morally problematic polycule,1
they will continue to Do Bad Things (but FOR each other instead of TO each other),1
Sev forgiving or letting things slide that he shouldn't bc he's profoundly lonely/affection-starved,1
yes the Jeverus truce-to-friendship-to-More is A Bit Fast but please just go with it :),1
mentioned(not graphic) underage relationship 25 year old & 17yr old (vernon dursley is a creep),1
Hurt Regulus Black,1
they're underage because they're 16 and 17 in this story,1

Only soul mates listed in the relationships area of the tags,1
there are other relationships,1
reference to attempted suicide,1
The one where we admit leading Snape to wolfed-out lupin was attempted murder,1
Thats a tag i can use now,1
Cause it finally applies to this story,1
Cause soulmates can do that ok,1
Did I mention Sadness?,1
But particularly during sixth and seventh year,1
in case nunya realized that by now,1
Sirius still moved on after he fell through the veil,1

which wasn't even an intentional choice lol,1
this fic is not snape friendly,1
i mean most of my fics aren't snape friendly,1
but this one especially,1
this is also VERY crackficcy,1
i was like a full bottle of wine deep when i was writing it so do with that knowledge what you will,1
i also managed to reference 5 of 7 taylor swift albums in here,1

James Potter being a shit,1

Lily's going to gut you James,1

Lily would really probably rather go back to being Sev's friend but won't admit it,1
James Potter does not do faithful well,1
James Potter falls in love too easily,1
Severus Snape finds his own cock boring,1
Severus Snape has social anxiety,1
Eat drink and be merry mentality,1
a bit of feminization,1
that thing were someone's opening themselves up to new experiences,1
and having a good time with some guy they just met,1
but he's actually their mortal enemy in disguise,1

the inherent emotional tension of staying at a difficult family member's house over a major holiday,1
for like the first time ever someone besides Wei Wuxian actually succeeds at killing Wei Wuxian,1
now historically killing Wei Wuxian without Wei Wuxian’s active participation,1

he graduated high school a year early and was lined up for MIT,1

why can't I stop writing about these two doofuses,1
humor with some angst cuz i'm a monster,1
some other avengers and characters are here but i'm hesitant to flood their tags,1
5 times + 1 other time is clearly my deepest weakness,1
don't look me in the eye,1
a field trip fic in which pete isnt Panicky but not thrilled either,1
NOW WITH ADDED ENDING NOTES,1
just a little fun extra dialogue,1
Rhodey is So Done,1
If Tony is Peter's Dad then Rhodey is Peter's exasperated Uncle,1
a spider friendship fic that no one asked for,1
also a little iron dad thrown in there because why not,1
"brief passover mentions of past steven ""skip"" westcott in conversations",1
but no one ever really explicitely addresses it,1
so I'm not even tagging him as a character,1

cause tony keeps saying he doesnt have kids,1
tony is a fool,1
Peter Has A Huge Crush On Steve,1
(somewhat literally),1
theres like no angst in here,1

I promise this is cute I know how the tags look but believe me,1

tommy was kidnapped FIRST,1
technoblade is just getting him back accidentally,1
Lots of cuddles,1
Alternate Universe - Dream Swap (Video Blogging RPF),1
C!Dream is a fucking asshole,1

Technoblade and Tommyinnit are brothers,1

INSPIRED BY RACOONINNIT'S EPIC PROMPTS,1

And minor appearance,1
Luckily Techno saves him,1
Accidental Manipulation,1
If you ignore the kidnapping part,1
But that's like the main plot,1
So don't ignore the kidnapping part,1
Wait thats just another word for kidnapping,1
Hoglin Hybrid TommyInnit (Video Blogging RPF),1
it's kind of a canon shift of like,1
dream smp hasn't quite happened yet,1
tommy ran away when he was 16 to 2b2t,1
and started fighting 'professionally',1
smp earth is like currently a thing i guess? but only loosely,1
it's been 3 years since tommy left and techno has finally come to grab him,1

Chat is a bunch of orphans,1
they are chaos incarnate,1
could be continued if you guys ask enough,1
implied starvation,1
dream gets dumped with glue and glitter,1
Written prior to the festival,1
So there are a lot of creative liberties,1
Essentially wanted to run with the idea of ‘Wilbur actually blows it all up’,1
Also weird family dynamics,1
Technoblade is trying his best,1
Possible Jschlatt redemption arc?,1
also yes I spelled it L’manburg.,1
I mean the festival blew up,1
Non-Graphic/Implied Violence,1
That has to be two tags. I've been messing with tags for a while now.,1
The road to the comfort is a long one — but it’s a functioning road nonetheless,1
They are polar bear hybrids your honor,1
sorry babes,1
not really at all though,1
i promise im not a dream apologist,1
c!dream is a fucking scumbag,1
i started writing this in december and i refused to change the plot,1
Dreamon Hunter Toby Smith | Tubbo,1
seriously though if any plot points happened after late december they are not included,1
so i guess this is,1
because you know the whole concept is a character being unaware that another is a person,1
To be clear the dehumanization is temporary,1
Posessive behaviour is not,1
ED being enabling life partners,1
mentioned 2b2t,1
Mentioned SMP Earth,1
TommyInnit was born in a lab,1
Lab Jack Manifold,1
Or hints to it,1
but not right at the start,1
whether he likes it or not,1
which is literally just,1
Wilbur and phil show up at the end,1
morally ambiguous - Freeform,1
but as a speedrun,1
Creepy feral child Tommy,1
Tommy scares the absolute shit out of Technoblade,1
Technoblade just wants to live his quiet retirement life,1
eldritch horror,1
I came up with this concept while in the fricken shower,1
sapnap is there for like five seconds,1
i have favoritism towards Dream and Techno and I'm not ashamed of it,1
Techno: what you got there,1
Tommy while in the middle of sneaking back into his house: a smoothie?,1
Raccooninnit baybeeee,1
Off-screen Character Death,1
Phil gets to be a little feral as a treat,1
He takes one look at Tommy and yoinks him,1
Shrek AU,1
Healing takes time,1
that boy is so traumatized,1
like if he were a real person he would have so many issues,1
he needs big therapy but all he gets is a big hug,1
This IS Going to Go The Way You Think,1
thats not a tag,1
Good Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1
Tommy just grew his wings,1
Post Technoblade's execution,1
Techno comes back from death to find a child that it's suddenly attached to him,1
Congrats on parenthood,1
Phil gets to be the cool uncle,1
Tommy uses we/us pronouns when talking about himself,1

i am both a c!Ranboo and c!Tommy kinnie yes we exist,1
Ranboo deserves better than the shit hes fiven so goddamnit ima write it,1
frienship ended with platonic husband now platonic husbands best friend (?) is my friend,1

bc sucks to be you but im built different /j,1
Am i projecting onto this fic? WHO KNOWS!,1
OOC maybe,1

hes dealing with instinct sauce rn,1
except their friendship is more akin to o!smp beeduo than dsmp!beeduo,1
listening to providence by poor mans poison for the most of these chapters,1
but thats at the end,1

In a Platonic Way,1

and arrows,1
Minecraft Mobs,1
realistic minecraft au,1
dream wears his mask but not when he's only around sbi,1

Techno's my older brother and Phil's our dad",1
And I have not let go of that quote SINCE,1
starting off strong,1
not dark sbi but,1
techno said no sbi family dynamics i say fuck off,1

Modded AU,1

Internalized Abuse,1
Tommy is Spiderman,1

a lot of people make an appearance and trust me - they all know he's Spiderman,1
niki is holding them all together as normal,1
bad is j Jonah Jameson bc I think it's funny,1
okayyy,1
Tommy and Techno seeing each other again after l'manburg just fucking DIES,1
They got a fuckton of issues,1
I'm a Techno apologist,1
And a Tommy apologist,1
Really just the entirely of SBI can do no wrong,1

Depressed Tommy,1
Self amputation,1

dream gets vibe checked,1
spoiler: he failed,1
Tommy is a vegan necromancer,1
Tommy is straight up not having a good time,1

Techno is a wandering mercenary,1
Tommy just wants a family again,1
Ranboo and TommyInnit friendship,1

a twist on Tommy’s golden apple addiction,1
set before the January 6th stream,1
Technoblade is (unfortunately) merely a family friend,1
Technoblade POV - Freeform,1
pt1 is Pulse Lite pt2 is the extended version,1
Techno is a family friend but he considers sbi as family,1
the chat makes an appearance a few times,1
Sad Philza Minecraft,1
Technoblade is Suffering,1
it's soft just read it i suck at summaries,1
its more implied,1
Blanket Permission Statement,1
Platonic Possesive,1
its not kidnapping if you called dibs,1
not very graphic but it's there,1
no beta we die like punz,1
Yes this is why he is in character tags,1
I need to complete my PUNZ IS GONE challenge,1
its more hybrid instincts but ao3 tags am I right?,1
not really but kinda?,1
it’s all wholesome I swear,1
I’m sorry Philza enjoyers,1
but it had to be done,1
I once again put Tommy through it,1
but there’s a lot of fluff this time so it’s ok right?,1
For a while. He gets a bit older.,1
I mean basically,1
they're all children,1
IT WAS JUST MEANT TO BE FLUFF DAMN YOU,1
no beta reader we die like my readers do when I don’t update tlyitds,1
by minor I mean incredibly painful but healed by the end of the fic and there’s no stabbing,1
The goverment is corrupt,1
Heroes are Corrupt,1
"But in like ""He commits murder for his loved ones""",1
not the possesive type,1
but no one dies from that,1
Punching,1
Everyone is in the story,1
everyone is a knight,1
techno is a bro,1
caught kissing,1
the whole palace knows and no one is surprised,1
Ending is chaos,1
Kinda I mean I THINK,1
Technoblade doesn't have a heart but that's okay Tommy will be his heart,1
Tommy is his humanity,1
He's also his accidental son but EHHHH,1
he's super minor though don't worry,1
he's there for like two seconds,1
yes this was partially inspired by Voltron leave me alone,1
Tommy gets adopted by an alternate universe,1
Platonic Beeduo Marriage,1
That's AE!Emerald Duo,1

Bad Technoblade,1
Good Technoblade,1
several actually,1
and cuddles,1
good techno and phil skip the 'get to know you' and go straight into adoption,1
bc im tired and honestly don't want to write all that,1
but i also desperatley want to write the au,1
maybe ill edit it later,1
no i wonr,1
we all know i wont,1
google docs is my beta,1
damn this is a lot of tags now that i'm lookin at this,1
All relationships are platonic,1
ALSO OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE CHARACTERS NOT THE CONTENT CREATORS,1
JUST THOUGHT I'D SPECIFY THAT AGAIN,1
he took one look at tommy and adopted him,1
everytime i update the tags get longer istg,1
Hacker!Tommy,1
(if you could call it that),1
minor body horror/gore descriptions?,1
or rather discontinued with the wip ending posted,1
thanks for everything techno and fans,1
Everybody was writing such good techno and tommy content and i wanted to join,1
so here you go,1
But Like For Hybrids,1
Kind of...,1
It's More Like A Bad Situation That They Deal With As Best As They Can,1
not really but he gives off the vibes for a hot minute,1
he's 5-7,1
Hibernating Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1
A lot actually,1
because techno has no idea what gender tommy is at first,1
he's a little gremlin,1
Tommy is a Prime devout and Techno respects that,1
he does not respect his freedom,1
Bedrockbros bonding time,1
conversations about faith,1
Obligatory: this is about the characters not the cc,1
is usually a hero-story thing but please,1
respect Techno's terrible and awkward attempts at remembering how mortals work,1
But no new archive warnings,1
Past/background Crimeboys,1
identity shenanigans are fun identity reveals less so,1
but in spirit,1
shhh it’s a secret,1
kinda not really tho,1

jealousblade,1
ONLY the AU Dream. Canon Dream is a bastard and we hate him &lt;3,1
Uncommon family dynamics,1
It's really hybrid instincts but shhh,1
Dream sucks in this one sorry,1
Tommy is a warrior with plot armor and you know what good for him,1
This is written so dramatically but then again it's midnight,1
So really that's not my fault,1
Based off my thread on twitter of Tommy being watched over by three gods,1
on his journey to be a warrior,1
Make Phil's tag not his name challenge,1
Techno is a Dragon,1
Brotherblade vibes,1
"Tommy is like ""I'm going to kill you!""",1
"and Techno goes ""oh god that's a child""",1
guess I'll adopt you,1
"He's a dragon of course he's gonna go ""yoink""",1
he sorta gets addicted to being dead,1
this one is sad guys,1
Yes I am still giving Tommy emotional support animals what about it,1
you can't stop me,1
To cope with actual c!Phil being a bit of a shitty dad lmao,1
They will get it so help me,1
He sucks as always,1
Minecraft Realism,1
Niki | Nihachu Redemption,1
Acts of service is this Tommy's love language,1

I know a lot of these tags look really intense but I swear it's not that bad,1
but MILD body horror,1

3k of fluff,1
Teenage Tobin and Chris,1
yes I'm afraid this is a draft fic,1
honestly i wrote it in 20 minutes as therapy,1
as if 2020 couldn't get any more depressing,1
my attempt to put a positive spin on some frankly sucky news,1
may delete later once I'm conscious enough to reread and comprehend its flaws,1
i needed to channel my emotions to happy thoughts,1

IT'S CHRISTMAS!!!,1
deck the halls with boughs of gay,1

but in short c+t catch the same train and either they talk to each other or they don't,1
SPOILER it doesn't matter,1
they end up together either way,1
Probably more to come idk yet,1

at first i was like hate sex as a joke,1
and then...,1
and then.,1

there is a lot of depictions of physical abuse and injuries here but it's not graphic,1
it's ARFID so like there's no body image issues going on with that,1
he struggles with a lack of appetite and won't eat unless it's a Specific Food He's Craving,1
semi-graphic depiction of physical abuse?,1
Sam has a dog and her name is Fran and she's a good dog,1

but i wont…not yet at least /hj,1
As of 01/03/2023 i have Major Character Death tagged,1
