Harry Potter Has a Good Life,2
harry potter time travels and Gets Shit Done,2
I love him,2
there are two harrys,2
half the tags apply to one and the other half apply to the other,2
he's an independent man who doesn't need hermione in his life,2
(he still kinda does but he gets by fine with out because he's actually competent),2
sirius gets a muggle job to spite his family but ends up loving it,2
he goes to college and everything,2
the potter's have a cat,2
harry gets a snake and james absolutely hates it,2
DID I MENTION HARRY GETS SHIT DONE,2
mans does a years work within two days,2
he gets to the past and says 'what the fuck are you DOING',2
he calls dumbledore's bullshit out on multiple occasions,2
he's not taking Any Shit this time around,2
he is determined to get his way no matter what,2
and guess what,2
it always works,2
dont get your hopes up for a completed story this is just for funsies :'),2
it's the longest thing i've ever written and i'm proud of it but i know it is Subpar,2
harry definitely doesn't have the emotional reactions he should but just pretend they're there,2
this is a lot of dialogue,2
relationships will probably not be developed properly but i am trying my best,2
it will not be a very good romance story but it'll be a story nonetheless so,2
characters will be ooc this cannot be avoided,2
i am incapable of writing a character that is fully in character,2
very fast paced in the first seven chapters,2
i needed to get to a point i was more comfortable writing about,2
like very fast paced tho,2
like i said,2
does a years work in two days,2
i am going to stop talking bad about my story,2

just FYI there won't be fixed top/bottom dynamics between James and Sev -they will switch,1

Sev forgiving or letting things slide that he shouldn't bc he's profoundly lonely/affection-starved,1
