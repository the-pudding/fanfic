harry potter time travels and Gets Shit Done,2
I love him,2
there are two harrys,2
half the tags apply to one and the other half apply to the other,2
he's an independent man who doesn't need hermione in his life,2
(he still kinda does but he gets by fine with out because he's actually competent),2
sirius gets a muggle job to spite his family but ends up loving it,2
he goes to college and everything,2
the potter's have a cat,2
harry gets a snake and james absolutely hates it,2
DID I MENTION HARRY GETS SHIT DONE,2
mans does a years work within two days,2
he gets to the past and says 'what the fuck are you DOING',2
he calls dumbledore's bullshit out on multiple occasions,2
he's not taking Any Shit this time around,2
he is determined to get his way no matter what,2
and guess what,2
it always works,2
dont get your hopes up for a completed story this is just for funsies :'),2
it's the longest thing i've ever written and i'm proud of it but i know it is Subpar,2
harry definitely doesn't have the emotional reactions he should but just pretend they're there,2
this is a lot of dialogue,2
relationships will probably not be developed properly but i am trying my best,2
it will not be a very good romance story but it'll be a story nonetheless so,2
characters will be ooc this cannot be avoided,2
i am incapable of writing a character that is fully in character,2
very fast paced in the first seven chapters,2
i needed to get to a point i was more comfortable writing about,2
like very fast paced tho,2
like i said,2
does a years work in two days,2

but I have affection for all of these characters and will attempt to do them justice warts and all,1
dany comes a lot later,1
i've been told this fic makes people uncomfortable,1
squirm-inducing even,1
like I said its dark,1

then you'd be RIGHT,1
though more plot heavy than normal tbh,1
and so I'm tagging it as,1

also this will be Very Long,1
enemies to penpals to buddies: the Jaime and Sansa story,1
Dany doesn't go mad but I'm also not a Dany stan so please don't expect that,1
also related: not a targ stan,1
I don't follow the plots of Seasons 7 and 8 at all but let's call it an AU of them anyway,1
some twincest but it's mostly in the past,1
warning for occasional suicidal ideation in Jaime and Robb's chapters especially,1
many canon mistakes because I am pretty bad at research,1
you know how people tag for Dark Characters? can i tag for Light Robb? Robb's super chill okay,1
Does ANYONE know what Brans powers are? Because I dont,1
Mind the Tags,1
namely mind this next tag:,1
this story will never withdraw even a quarter of an inch from Jaime Lannister's ass so jot that down,1
also i don't care about westeros politics so if that's your jam just be prepared for disappointment,1
in the home stretch now so reminder: THIS IS A BIG JAIME POSITIVE STORY,1
I can't tell you how easy it will be to NOT click on this if you're a stark stan who hates Jaime,1
just don't read it my dude there's a pandemic on go learn a new language or something,1

and I won't even be angry about it because you'll be right to want to kill me,1
also I'm not tagging the smut chapter anymore because I keep combining chapters in edits and fuck it,1
I was advised to tag this heavy angst,1
so I'm tagging it heavy angst,1
but it does have a happy ending I swear,1
I confirmed it on tumblr if you don't believe me,1
people keep asking me because this is so angsty and no one believes,1
it has a happy ending,1
