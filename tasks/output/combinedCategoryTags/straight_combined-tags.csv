harry potter time travels and Gets Shit Done,2
I love him,2
there are two harrys,2
half the tags apply to one and the other half apply to the other,2
he's an independent man who doesn't need hermione in his life,2
(he still kinda does but he gets by fine with out because he's actually competent),2
sirius gets a muggle job to spite his family but ends up loving it,2
he goes to college and everything,2
the potter's have a cat,2
harry gets a snake and james absolutely hates it,2
DID I MENTION HARRY GETS SHIT DONE,2
mans does a years work within two days,2
he gets to the past and says 'what the fuck are you DOING',2
he calls dumbledore's bullshit out on multiple occasions,2
he's not taking Any Shit this time around,2
he is determined to get his way no matter what,2
and guess what,2
it always works,2
dont get your hopes up for a completed story this is just for funsies :'),2
it's the longest thing i've ever written and i'm proud of it but i know it is Subpar,2
harry definitely doesn't have the emotional reactions he should but just pretend they're there,2
this is a lot of dialogue,2
relationships will probably not be developed properly but i am trying my best,2
it will not be a very good romance story but it'll be a story nonetheless so,2
characters will be ooc this cannot be avoided,2
i am incapable of writing a character that is fully in character,2
very fast paced in the first seven chapters,2
i needed to get to a point i was more comfortable writing about,2
like very fast paced tho,2
like i said,2
does a years work in two days,2

and then the other boys join in,1
louis is sad but harry loves him,1
so of course doting best friend turned boyfriend harry makes it all go away,1
of course that's not how it works in real life,1
having a boyfriend doesn't doesn't fix people but it can give them a reason to fix themselves,1
love yourselves,1

this is pretty dark,1
i'm no shipper sir,1
and have no dog in this fight,1
but I have affection for all of these characters and will attempt to do them justice warts and all,1
dany comes a lot later,1
i've been told this fic makes people uncomfortable,1
squirm-inducing even,1
like I said its dark,1
if you've read my other fics and thought that like them this would have no plot,1
then you'd be RIGHT,1
though more plot heavy than normal tbh,1
and so I'm tagging it as,1
s8 spec,1
Jaime is defs in love with sansa through the middle of this fic,1

basis of fic is 'I'm gonna manipulate you for my own gain and oops I'm attached',1
We play with Dream's lore seeing as we barely have any canon backstory,1
In the 'cool motive but you're still fucked up and a villain' boat for c!Dream in canon and AU,1
It gets worse then better then SO MUCH WORSE,1
I'll add more tags as I add chapters,1

and I won't even be angry about it because you'll be right to want to kill me,1
also I'm not tagging the smut chapter anymore because I keep combining chapters in edits and fuck it,1
I was advised to tag this heavy angst,1
so I'm tagging it heavy angst,1
but it does have a happy ending I swear,1
I confirmed it on tumblr if you don't believe me,1
people keep asking me because this is so angsty and no one believes,1
it has a happy ending,1
I SWEAR TO GOD IT DOES,1
completing my daily quota of sighs and smirks and sneers,1
