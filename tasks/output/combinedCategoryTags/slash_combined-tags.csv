(hope this helps),1
Post-Last Life,1
not the smp I mean like actual afterlife,1
now that I think about it. this can be read as post-empires if you squint,1
couldn’t fully commit to fh angst and now it’s basically just fluff,1
Subterfuge,1
Star - Freeform,1
Advent,1
Jimmy is short because yes,1
the god of stars and champions to be exact,1
jimmy is so mortal,1
and he knows what a bad idea it is to fall in love with a god,1
but really who can blame him?,1
I mean its 3rd life come on what do you expect,1
they're fucking a lot,1
Relationships are listed in approximately decreasing order of importance,1
jimmy/scott is the drop off to secondary imo,1
the ones towards the end are mostly just sexual or off screen,1
basically if you're specifically here for impdubs then this isn't it,1
but if you need to avoid them at all costs (why?) then you can filter this one out,1
Soulmates feel each other's sexy times,1
and decide to experiment with soulmate swapping,1
Good sex and complicated emotion arise,1
copious amounts of sex,1
but the plot is the relationships,1
(it's me so of course it's all emotional plot),1
A lot of interpersonal complexity,1
Messy polyamory but no one is acting in bad faith,1
people pleaser jimmy,1
jimmy doesn't have good boundaries with trying to please other people,1
everything is always consensual and he never regrets anything,1
but he's very very focused on other people,1
joel is an emotional disaster,1
like someone get that boy a therapist,1
Who know what they are doing,1
And he’s not fucking,1
There’s some big relationship conflict,1
Praise kink Degradation,1
But like being in the same room and it’s all on purpose,1
Shifting Power Dynamics,1
There’s things that are never going to be said,1
But because people decide that it’s for the best,1
Assume everyone is a vers switch cause they probably are,1
More characters and tag might be added,1
Double Life lasts months not weeks,1
Who cares about death games when you can have really complicated orgies,1
I put a dropdown in the author's notes for relationship details,1
to help guide your decisions if you want to know how much your otp will be vibing,1
or fucking,1
or Both,1
(not gone into extensive detail and no one else is hybrids or whatnot),1
no one is technically cheating but there's some weird stuff happening over in cheating quartet,1
though scott is lonely and confused before there's any comfort,1
Mainly focused on the Empires SMP,1
Other SMPs are past lives,1
also no Double Life here,1
there's a lot of extra empires world building,1
and I take some liberties with the other smps especially origins bc I barely watch it,1
i hope it's ok,1
Past Lifes,1
i have no idea what I’m doing but I’m doing something so that’s good right?,1

i guess although its more like internal crying,1
but only very slight angst,1
the inherent emotional tension of staying at a difficult family member's house over a major holiday,1
for like the first time ever someone besides Wei Wuxian actually succeeds at killing Wei Wuxian,1
now historically killing Wei Wuxian without Wei Wuxian’s active participation,1

to being a thinly veiled excuse for Jiang Cheng to yell at people who look funny at his brother,1
no regrets tbh,1
