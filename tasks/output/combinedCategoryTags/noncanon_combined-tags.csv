Only Tommy knows because he was there when it happened,1
They told literally no one else though,1
Fuck communication am I right,1

but I have affection for all of these characters and will attempt to do them justice warts and all,1
dany comes a lot later,1
i've been told this fic makes people uncomfortable,1
squirm-inducing even,1
like I said its dark,1
if you've read my other fics and thought that like them this would have no plot,1
then you'd be RIGHT,1
though more plot heavy than normal tbh,1
and so I'm tagging it as,1
s8 spec,1
Jaime is defs in love with sansa through the middle of this fic,1
i mean who isn't,1

I don't follow the plots of Seasons 7 and 8 at all but let's call it an AU of them anyway,1
some twincest but it's mostly in the past,1
warning for occasional suicidal ideation in Jaime and Robb's chapters especially,1
many canon mistakes because I am pretty bad at research,1
you know how people tag for Dark Characters? can i tag for Light Robb? Robb's super chill okay,1
Does ANYONE know what Brans powers are? Because I dont,1
namely mind this next tag:,1
this story will never withdraw even a quarter of an inch from Jaime Lannister's ass so jot that down,1
also i don't care about westeros politics so if that's your jam just be prepared for disappointment,1
in the home stretch now so reminder: THIS IS A BIG JAIME POSITIVE STORY,1
I can't tell you how easy it will be to NOT click on this if you're a stark stan who hates Jaime,1

in which kara doesn't understand that supergirl's lips are actually prime real estate,1
in which lena ABSOLUTELY understands that supergirl's lips are prime real estate,1
in which lena pays a completely reasonable amount of money to kiss kara (for charity!),1
possibly the gayest reason to use 'a super and a luthor working together',1

rated T for shameless shelf-interest and textual tension,1
& also countless allusions to Lena Luthor‚Äôs luscious good looks,1
Lena needs a break and her kryptonian girlfriend though she is aware of neither requirement,1
Good thing Kara is far more astute than people give her credit for,1

this is just a fic full of self-indulgent fluff,1
lena has a baby!,1
also i feel like i should mention here,1
the smut got wildly out of hand,1

Overuse of the nickname Kid,1
Not Medically Accurate,1
Don't take any medical advice seriously here,1
Pepper Potts Also Acting as Peter Parker's Parental Figure,1
she's not bad or dark though don't worry,1
someone thought it'd be smart to just let all the teen snap victims graduate,1
and by someone i mean me,1
Drama Trauma and lots of self indulgent shit,1
Hand Wavy Medical Procedures,1

Protective Nebula (Marvel),1
but this is rlly good i swear,1
Morgan Stark/Nathaniel Barton (briefly),1
i feel like,1
i feel like they'd just be so cute okay,1
but i didn't want to stick it in the relationships bc it's barely mentioned,1
it's just a concept i really need in life,1
id love to use a no beta tag but there was actually 4 different betas,1
that seems so understated for what it is,1

Just one line but I'm tagging it anyway,1
Happy is trying his best,1
Pepper is mentioned once,1
