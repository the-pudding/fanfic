Platonically Married Wilbur Soot and Niki | Nihachu,1
You know how people get married to their friends when they get to a certain age,1
When they haven’t met anyone,1
Thats basically what they did,1
Plus some merling thing where merling’s need schools,1
Like fish schools not education,1
Wilbur was drunk,1
Niki was sleep deprived,1
Only Tommy knows because he was there when it happened,1
They told literally no one else though,1
Fuck communication am I right,1
there are other characters mentioned but they get mentioned like once,1
if I continue this then they'll get added,1
not all of them are royals technically,1

Specifically the shower at London NYC hotel,1
Literally how this fic got started,1
(like if you squint real hard),1
basically harry and louis are,1
with a,1
which consisted mostly of spending an entire week in their hotel room and fucking like bunnies,1
and now it's awkward because they have to work together,1
and somehow their pesky attraction keeps being in the way,1
there's also some,1
because they are dumb boys that suck at communicating their feelings,1
also there's mention of,1
Underwater Blow Jobs,1
basically instead of taking about their feelings the boys have a lot of sex,1
and break into places,1
as the actual intercourse happens off screen,1
the spanking is really mild,1
that is obviously not platonic,1
Louis tries to escape a few times,1
Louis also has a great wardrobe every girl would kill for,1

in which kara doesn't understand that supergirl's lips are actually prime real estate,1
in which lena ABSOLUTELY understands that supergirl's lips are prime real estate,1
in which lena pays a completely reasonable amount of money to kiss kara (for charity!),1
possibly the gayest reason to use 'a super and a luthor working together',1

so it’s at least canon adjacent,1
rated T for shameless shelf-interest and textual tension,1
& also countless allusions to Lena Luthor’s luscious good looks,1

but otherwise it's just them being gay and dumb,1
unrequited love but IS IT THO type of thing,1
not me shining a light on some of the lasting implications of the finale,1
that canon tried to shove under the carpet,1
soft and healing and hopeful,1

at which point instead of aggressively (‘platonically’) courting Lena Luthor,1
(a completely inaccessible and rightfully guarded billionaire she’s literally just met),1
Kara Danvers tries to focus that energy on doing her actual dream job,1
a noble goal which goes right out the window,1
when they’re shoved together in close quarters for three and a half weeks,1
[affectionately],1
wildly inaccurate assumptions about the American criminal justice system,1
sex under the influence of alcohol,1

well more like best friends to enemies to friends again to lovers,1
it's a university au but they're both professors,1
trying desperately not to make this like every other ABO fic,1
probably failing miserably,1
even as an alpha kara is hopeless,1

think of it as a reward,1
a smutty reward,1
