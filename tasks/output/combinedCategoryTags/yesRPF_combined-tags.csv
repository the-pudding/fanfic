Post-Last Life,1
not the smp I mean like actual afterlife,1
now that I think about it. this can be read as post-empires if you squint,1

Subterfuge,1
Star - Freeform,1
Advent,1
Jimmy is short because yes,1
the god of stars and champions to be exact,1
jimmy is so mortal,1
and he knows what a bad idea it is to fall in love with a god,1
but really who can blame him?,1
I mean its 3rd life come on what do you expect,1
they're fucking a lot,1
Relationships are listed in approximately decreasing order of importance,1
jimmy/scott is the drop off to secondary imo,1
the ones towards the end are mostly just sexual or off screen,1
basically if you're specifically here for impdubs then this isn't it,1
but if you need to avoid them at all costs (why?) then you can filter this one out,1
Soulmates feel each other's sexy times,1
and decide to experiment with soulmate swapping,1
Good sex and complicated emotion arise,1
copious amounts of sex,1
but the plot is the relationships,1
(it's me so of course it's all emotional plot),1
A lot of interpersonal complexity,1
Messy polyamory but no one is acting in bad faith,1
people pleaser jimmy,1
jimmy doesn't have good boundaries with trying to please other people,1
everything is always consensual and he never regrets anything,1
but he's very very focused on other people,1
joel is an emotional disaster,1
like someone get that boy a therapist,1
Who know what they are doing,1
And he’s not fucking,1
There’s some big relationship conflict,1
Praise kink Degradation,1
But like being in the same room and it’s all on purpose,1
Shifting Power Dynamics,1
There’s things that are never going to be said,1
But because people decide that it’s for the best,1
Assume everyone is a vers switch cause they probably are,1
More characters and tag might be added,1
Double Life lasts months not weeks,1
Who cares about death games when you can have really complicated orgies,1
I put a dropdown in the author's notes for relationship details,1
to help guide your decisions if you want to know how much your otp will be vibing,1
or fucking,1
(not gone into extensive detail and no one else is hybrids or whatnot),1
no one is technically cheating but there's some weird stuff happening over in cheating quartet,1
though scott is lonely and confused before there's any comfort,1
Mainly focused on the Empires SMP,1
Other SMPs are past lives,1
also no Double Life here,1
there's a lot of extra empires world building,1
and I take some liberties with the other smps especially origins bc I barely watch it,1
i hope it's ok,1

i need to stop writing evil tubbo,1
I dont know how it keeps happening,1
Canon? I dont know her,1
Does it count if Techno is too gone to realize he's been kidnapped for a decent chunk of the fic?,1
kinda squared,1
so............ about recent events,1
they talk abt what dream did to tommy a lot,1
nothing graphic but tommy has both scars and fresher cuts,1
and it's implied techno has self-harmed before too,1
i will continue to ignore the fact that wilbur and techno are canonically twins,1
middle child technoblade supremacy,1
talk of manipulation,1
this is just me freaking out and writing a fic really quickly,1
or quickly for me anyway,1
this took like 3-4 hours lmao,1
its not super obvious but all my fics have that,1
Implied/Referenced Disordered Eating,1
listen im having a night,1

not edited because i'm finishing it at 4am,1
update: it's noon the next day. i edited it,1
it might be better idk,1
christ i have no idea how to tag,1
basically tommy grows up in the nether. the ideal habitat for a human child,1
such a fun setting to write in,1
i guess? but hes not too worried abt it,1
mild handwaving of the physical effects of a human child growing up in basically cave hell,1

Wilbur is there for one chapter lol,1
Poor Tommy is going through it,1
Technically he's like. seven. but close enough to a baby,1
Also Tommy's pretty sure he's going to be eaten at one point,1
He is never in danger of it but he doesn't know that,1
I promise this is cute I know how the tags look but believe me,1
Royal Sbi adopts Tommy,1

updating to say to read the tags and tws and that I meant it when I said dark Phil guys,1
lost in the baby sauce,1
technically de-aging?,1
but i suck at writing instincts,1
technically tommy is rebound,1
for himself LMAO,1
it's technically not kidnapping,1
tommy was kidnapped FIRST,1
technoblade is just getting him back accidentally,1
Alternate Universe - Dream Swap (Video Blogging RPF),1
C!Dream is a fucking asshole,1
Spread it around,1
maybe x2,1
technoblade just kinda snatches him and nobody really has an issue with it,1
Just very very angsty,1
I meant to write fluff then o o p s,1
Dream isnt a good guy in this one /smp,1
They may not be related by blood but damnit they can still look out for each other,1

Feral tommy,1
Techno is done,1
He wants blood,1
takes place right before the techno vs dream duel,1
alternate title: tommy gives dream a heart attack,1
Sapnap is there for like two seconds,1
Sort of...,1
but like no explicit scenes of it I guess,1
slightly suicidal thoughts,1
only slightllyyyyy I swear,1
Neither of them know what the fuck is going on half the time,1
Technoblade and Tommyinnit are brothers,1
Tommy is just tommy,1
dream is an asshole who makes tommy suppress his adhd stims,1
INSPIRED BY RACOONINNIT'S EPIC PROMPTS,1
thank you youre a real one for these,1
And minor appearance,1
He's not having a good time,1
Luckily Techno saves him,1
Accidental Manipulation,1
If you ignore the kidnapping part,1
But that's like the main plot,1
So don't ignore the kidnapping part,1
Wait thats just another word for kidnapping,1
Hoglin Hybrid TommyInnit (Video Blogging RPF),1
it's kind of a canon shift of like,1
dream smp hasn't quite happened yet,1
tommy ran away when he was 16 to 2b2t,1
and started fighting 'professionally',1
smp earth is like currently a thing i guess? but only loosely,1
it's been 3 years since tommy left and techno has finally come to grab him,1
quackity and dream play sort of minor roles,1
Obsessive Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1
I swear this will have a happy ending,1
Tommy just has to suffer for a bit :(,1
Rapid Adoption,1
is here too because they're poggers,1
canon? i don't know her,1
racooninnit,1
all my homies HATE smp!dream,1
Mostly Crack,1
Chat is a bunch of orphans,1
they are chaos incarnate,1
could be continued if you guys ask enough,1
implied starvation,1
dream gets dumped with glue and glitter,1
Written prior to the festival,1
So there are a lot of creative liberties,1
Essentially wanted to run with the idea of ‘Wilbur actually blows it all up’,1
Also weird family dynamics,1
Technoblade is trying his best,1
Possible Jschlatt redemption arc?,1
also yes I spelled it L’manburg.,1
I mean the festival blew up,1
Non-Graphic/Implied Violence,1
That has to be two tags. I've been messing with tags for a while now.,1
The road to the comfort is a long one — but it’s a functioning road nonetheless,1
They are polar bear hybrids your honor,1
sorry babes,1
not really at all though,1
i promise im not a dream apologist,1
c!dream is a fucking scumbag,1
i started writing this in december and i refused to change the plot,1
seriously though if any plot points happened after late december they are not included,1
so i guess this is,1
because you know the whole concept is a character being unaware that another is a person,1
To be clear the dehumanization is temporary,1
Posessive behaviour is not,1
ED being enabling life partners,1
mentioned 2b2t,1
Mentioned SMP Earth,1
TommyInnit was born in a lab,1
Lab Jack Manifold,1
Or hints to it,1

by minor I mean incredibly painful but healed by the end of the fic and there’s no stabbing,1
The goverment is corrupt,1

but no one dies from that,1
Everyone is in the story,1

he's 5-7,1
Hibernating Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1
A lot actually,1
because techno has no idea what gender tommy is at first,1
he's a little gremlin,1
Tommy is a Prime devout and Techno respects that,1
he does not respect his freedom,1
Bedrockbros bonding time,1

on his journey to be a warrior,1
Hot Springs & Onsen,1
Make Phil's tag not his name challenge,1
Techno is a Dragon,1
Brotherblade vibes,1

may delete later once I'm conscious enough to reread and comprehend its flaws,1
i needed to channel my emotions to happy thoughts,1

it's ARFID so like there's no body image issues going on with that,1
he struggles with a lack of appetite and won't eat unless it's a Specific Food He's Craving,1
semi-graphic depiction of physical abuse?,1

Not canon to the main storyline,1
I repeat THIS IS JUST A DRABBLE PHIL IS GONNA BE FINE,1

Mental Coercion,1

Chapter 10: things get darker,1
Dream is a little bitch in this one ngl,1
But it's okay he gets character development,1

this fic is my own little bottle of unhappiness written on a whim based on an idea I had,1

dead brothers can be helpful sometimes,1
but like a lot of hurt before the comfort,1
This will end in crime boys feelings,1
This is about roleplay characters and has nothing to do with the ccs portraying them,1
none of my work should ever be interpreted as ship,1
additional warnings:,1
because exile was an abduction let’s be clear,1
rated M for violence,1
Exile Arc on the Dream SMP canon divergence,1

also this was supposed to be under 5000 words,1
it's more like a curse than a real life illness tho,1
sometimes you're a vampire hunter and end up with a depressed vampire as your roommate,1
the tags make it look sad but I promise this is actually pretty wholesome,1
google what do you do when the vampire you're trying to kill is depressed,1
