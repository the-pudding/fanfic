Post-Last Life,1
not the smp I mean like actual afterlife,1
now that I think about it. this can be read as post-empires if you squint,1
couldn‚Äôt fully commit to fh angst and now it‚Äôs basically just fluff,1
Subterfuge,1
Star - Freeform,1
Advent,1
Jimmy is short because yes,1
the god of stars and champions to be exact,1
jimmy is so mortal,1
and he knows what a bad idea it is to fall in love with a god,1
but really who can blame him?,1
I mean its 3rd life come on what do you expect,1
they're fucking a lot,1
Relationships are listed in approximately decreasing order of importance,1
jimmy/scott is the drop off to secondary imo,1
the ones towards the end are mostly just sexual or off screen,1
basically if you're specifically here for impdubs then this isn't it,1
but if you need to avoid them at all costs (why?) then you can filter this one out,1
Soulmates feel each other's sexy times,1
and decide to experiment with soulmate swapping,1
Good sex and complicated emotion arise,1
copious amounts of sex,1
but the plot is the relationships,1
(it's me so of course it's all emotional plot),1
A lot of interpersonal complexity,1
Messy polyamory but no one is acting in bad faith,1
people pleaser jimmy,1
jimmy doesn't have good boundaries with trying to please other people,1
everything is always consensual and he never regrets anything,1
but he's very very focused on other people,1
joel is an emotional disaster,1
like someone get that boy a therapist,1
Who know what they are doing,1
And he‚Äôs not fucking,1
There‚Äôs some big relationship conflict,1
Praise kink Degradation,1
But like being in the same room and it‚Äôs all on purpose,1
Shifting Power Dynamics,1
There‚Äôs things that are never going to be said,1
But because people decide that it‚Äôs for the best,1
Assume everyone is a vers switch cause they probably are,1
More characters and tag might be added,1
Double Life lasts months not weeks,1
Who cares about death games when you can have really complicated orgies,1
I put a dropdown in the author's notes for relationship details,1
to help guide your decisions if you want to know how much your otp will be vibing,1
or fucking,1
(not gone into extensive detail and no one else is hybrids or whatnot),1
no one is technically cheating but there's some weird stuff happening over in cheating quartet,1
though scott is lonely and confused before there's any comfort,1
Mainly focused on the Empires SMP,1
Other SMPs are past lives,1
also no Double Life here,1
there's a lot of extra empires world building,1
and I take some liberties with the other smps especially origins bc I barely watch it,1
i hope it's ok,1
Past Lifes,1
i have no idea what I‚Äôm doing but I‚Äôm doing something so that‚Äôs good right?,1

im a simp for fluff so expect a lot of that,1
ranboo thinks they are the shit,1
there is one (1) romantic relationship,1
and that is phil and kristin,1
because phil loves his eldritch goddess wife,1
phil tubbo and wilbur won't show up for a bit,1
so they arent tagged as characters yet,1
tagging is the worst,1
I hate it,1
weird family customs,1
more of Trying his best parent phil watson,1

well technically ram but i cant find that tag and rams are just male sheep,1
its platonic we're not doing that here,1
Tommy is observant but comes to the wrong conclusions about said observations half the time,1
From his perspective this is a horror novel,1
for everyone else it's a comedy of errors and Wilbur Soot,1
maybe the real religion is the friends we made along the way,1

Techno is in deep shit,1
Techno gets kidnapped as a kid and really screwed up,1
Techno isn't a hybrid but he basically becomes one by the end,1
Technoblade never dies so you'll be FINE,1

Guiltza,1
Memento mori,1
Magical Karl Jacobs,1
Magical Forest,1
Original setting,1
Dragon Sapnap,1
Not in a weird way lmfao,1
this fic is hard to tag because tommy doesnt know shit about fuck for whats going on,1
and a lot of shit is implied,1
humans decide to go fishing,1
fuck it ill add other tags later,1
not entirely folklore correct,1
it's slight,1
like for one chapter because they are cryptic and not really human but yeah,1

i need to stop writing evil tubbo,1
I dont know how it keeps happening,1
Canon? I dont know her,1
Does it count if Techno is too gone to realize he's been kidnapped for a decent chunk of the fic?,1
kinda squared,1
so............ about recent events,1
they talk abt what dream did to tommy a lot,1
nothing graphic but tommy has both scars and fresher cuts,1
and it's implied techno has self-harmed before too,1
i will continue to ignore the fact that wilbur and techno are canonically twins,1
middle child technoblade supremacy,1
talk of manipulation,1
this is just me freaking out and writing a fic really quickly,1
or quickly for me anyway,1
this took like 3-4 hours lmao,1

not edited because i'm finishing it at 4am,1
update: it's noon the next day. i edited it,1
it might be better idk,1
christ i have no idea how to tag,1
basically tommy grows up in the nether. the ideal habitat for a human child,1
such a fun setting to write in,1
i guess? but hes not too worried abt it,1
mild handwaving of the physical effects of a human child growing up in basically cave hell,1
"techno ""orphan punter"" blade is denied putting his title into practice. thanks phil",1
this feels like a setup piece more than anything tbh,1
evil blob man,1

He is never in danger of it but he doesn't know that,1
I promise this is cute I know how the tags look but believe me,1

lost in the baby sauce,1
technically de-aging?,1
but i suck at writing instincts,1
technically tommy is rebound,1
for himself LMAO,1
it's technically not kidnapping,1
tommy was kidnapped FIRST,1
technoblade is just getting him back accidentally,1
Alternate Universe - Dream Swap (Video Blogging RPF),1
C!Dream is a fucking asshole,1
Spread it around,1

technoblade just kinda snatches him and nobody really has an issue with it,1
Just very very angsty,1
I meant to write fluff then o o p s,1
Dream isnt a good guy in this one /smp,1
They may not be related by blood but damnit they can still look out for each other,1

alternate title: tommy gives dream a heart attack,1
Sapnap is there for like two seconds,1
Sort of...,1
but like no explicit scenes of it I guess,1
slightly suicidal thoughts,1
only slightllyyyyy I swear,1
Neither of them know what the fuck is going on half the time,1
Technoblade and Tommyinnit are brothers,1
Tommy is just tommy,1
dream is an asshole who makes tommy suppress his adhd stims,1
INSPIRED BY RACOONINNIT'S EPIC PROMPTS,1
thank you youre a real one for these,1
And minor appearance,1
He's not having a good time,1
Luckily Techno saves him,1
Accidental Manipulation,1
If you ignore the kidnapping part,1
But that's like the main plot,1
So don't ignore the kidnapping part,1
Wait thats just another word for kidnapping,1
Hoglin Hybrid TommyInnit (Video Blogging RPF),1
it's kind of a canon shift of like,1
dream smp hasn't quite happened yet,1
tommy ran away when he was 16 to 2b2t,1
and started fighting 'professionally',1
smp earth is like currently a thing i guess? but only loosely,1
it's been 3 years since tommy left and techno has finally come to grab him,1
quackity and dream play sort of minor roles,1
Obsessive Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1
I swear this will have a happy ending,1
Tommy just has to suffer for a bit :(,1
Rapid Adoption,1
is here too because they're poggers,1
canon? i don't know her,1
racooninnit,1
all my homies HATE smp!dream,1
Mostly Crack,1
Chat is a bunch of orphans,1
they are chaos incarnate,1
could be continued if you guys ask enough,1
implied starvation,1
dream gets dumped with glue and glitter,1
Written prior to the festival,1
So there are a lot of creative liberties,1
Essentially wanted to run with the idea of ‚ÄòWilbur actually blows it all up‚Äô,1
Also weird family dynamics,1
Technoblade is trying his best,1
Possible Jschlatt redemption arc?,1
also yes I spelled it L‚Äômanburg.,1
I mean the festival blew up,1
Non-Graphic/Implied Violence,1
That has to be two tags. I've been messing with tags for a while now.,1
The road to the comfort is a long one ‚Äî but it‚Äôs a functioning road nonetheless,1
They are polar bear hybrids your honor,1
sorry babes,1
not really at all though,1
i promise im not a dream apologist,1
c!dream is a fucking scumbag,1
i started writing this in december and i refused to change the plot,1
seriously though if any plot points happened after late december they are not included,1
so i guess this is,1
because you know the whole concept is a character being unaware that another is a person,1
To be clear the dehumanization is temporary,1
Posessive behaviour is not,1
ED being enabling life partners,1
mentioned 2b2t,1
Mentioned SMP Earth,1
TommyInnit was born in a lab,1
Lab Jack Manifold,1
Or hints to it,1
but not right at the start,1
whether he likes it or not,1
which is literally just,1
Wilbur and phil show up at the end,1
morally ambiguous - Freeform,1
but as a speedrun,1
Creepy feral child Tommy,1
Tommy scares the absolute shit out of Technoblade,1
Technoblade just wants to live his quiet retirement life,1
I came up with this concept while in the fricken shower,1
sapnap is there for like five seconds,1
i have favoritism towards Dream and Techno and I'm not ashamed of it,1
Techno: what you got there,1
Tommy while in the middle of sneaking back into his house: a smoothie?,1
Raccooninnit baybeeee,1
Off-screen Character Death,1
Phil gets to be a little feral as a treat,1
He takes one look at Tommy and yoinks him,1
Shrek AU,1
Healing takes time,1
that boy is so traumatized,1
like if he were a real person he would have so many issues,1
he needs big therapy but all he gets is a big hug,1
This IS Going to Go The Way You Think,1
thats not a tag,1
Tommy just grew his wings,1
Post Technoblade's execution,1
Techno comes back from death to find a child that it's suddenly attached to him,1
Congrats on parenthood,1
Phil gets to be the cool uncle,1
Tommy uses we/us pronouns when talking about himself,1
but is mainly referred to using he/him,1
i am both a c!Ranboo and c!Tommy kinnie yes we exist,1
Ranboo deserves better than the shit hes fiven so goddamnit ima write it,1
frienship ended with platonic husband now platonic husbands best friend (?) is my friend,1
Techs trying his best,1
bc sucks to be you but im built different /j,1
working through trauma,1
Am i projecting onto this fic? WHO KNOWS!,1
OOC maybe,1
in like... a good way i swear,1
hes dealing with instinct sauce rn,1
except their friendship is more akin to o!smp beeduo than dsmp!beeduo,1
listening to providence by poor mans poison for the most of these chapters,1
but thats at the end,1
no beta we die like my psych grade,1
Wordcount: Over 10.000,1
In a Platonic Way,1
dream dies but hes the villian so its okay,1

Prince Techno,1
knight dream,1
the Dream and Fundy is onesided,1

I had so many tags I wanted to add and then I forgot them all,1
when will I not write something with pining,1
the world may never know,1
there is a mention of blood,1
and arrows,1
Minecraft Mobs,1
dream wears his mask but not when he's only around sbi,1
more like I wrote a sentence and realized it sounded sexual and was like ok well whatever,1
He just works for the heroes,1
TommyInnit Gets a Break (Video Blogging RPF),1
Alternate Universe - Hypixel Setting (Video Blogging RPF),1

MY FIRST BETAED FIC! LET'S GO?!,1

Comfort?,1
oldest brother techno supremacy,1
everyone takes a nap,1
that's it thats the story,1
Wilbur said:,1
"It really is like I have a little brother (Tommy),1
Techno's my older brother and Phil's our dad",1
And I have not let go of that quote SINCE,1
starting off strong,1
not dark sbi but,1
techno said no sbi family dynamics i say fuck off,1
3/4 SBI im sorry guys not my fault Will's dead,1
but it's more backround tbh,1
in the form of selective amnesia,1
will add tags later as story progresses,1

Pre-Doomsday,1
:smirk emoji:,1
tommyinnit is a menace,1
Tommy just wants a nap,1

Tommy and Tubbo are twelve,1
not so accidental,1
Uncle Wilbur Soot,1
Alternate Universe - Zoo,1
tw for mentions of self harm,1
dream is a nervous wreck,1
Tommy is a wreck in general,1
at least there are tigers,1
he takes a backseat for this one but just know that he DOES,1
tommy thinks stuff is his fault,1
author is a filthy projector,1
im not a doctor but the main medical part of this is based on experience,1
JK i Lied,1
General Dream,1
they are very minor,1
but towards hybrids,1
techno is massive,1
he's big,1

tommy having various mental breakdowns,1
phil and techno try their best,1
too many parentheses and italics rip,1
tommy can have a little hypothermia,1
TommyInnit has scars,1
Modded AU,1
Malnourishment,1
Internalized Abuse,1
Tommy is Spiderman,1
and Techno is decidedly Not freaking out,1
Wilbur is a Spiderman enthusiast,1
even more so when he finds out Spiderman is a Child,1
a lot of people make an appearance and trust me - they all know he's Spiderman,1
niki is holding them all together as normal,1
bad is j Jonah Jameson bc I think it's funny,1
okayyy,1
Tommy and Techno seeing each other again after l'manburg just fucking DIES,1
They got a fuckton of issues,1
I'm a Techno apologist,1
And a Tommy apologist,1
Really just the entirely of SBI can do no wrong,1
They literally destroy l'manburg and put it into ashes in this fic,1
and that's a-okay,1
It's just their vibes really,1
Depressed Tommy,1
Self amputation,1
finally Tommy gets help,1
Phil is such a good dad,1
Techno is gonna murder green boy,1
Loosely Follows Canon,1
Angst with a happy ending?,1
Phil deserves a raise,1
baby Techno is quite feral,1
Baby's First Fanfic,1
I say hurt/comfort to lull you into a false sense of security,1
Don't get me wrong! There's a little bit in there! But it is mostly angst,1
Protective Docm77,1
Bad Parent Technoblade,1
Bad Parent FoolishG,1
Protective Eryn | Cyberonix,1
Technoblade has Auditory Hallucinations,1

Angels and Dreamons,1
Magical powers and shit,1
Major character death...? :),1
Blind Dream,1
this is really just crack but like with effort,1
Techno's chat is canon,1
he said so,1
therefore I'm gonna just go wild with it,1
Tommy's an annoyance and you know what it makes sense,1
Brotherly vibes go brrr,1
Techno finds Tommy under his basement,1
guess how that goes,1
This was posted like not that long after the stream where Techno finds him btw,1
Raccoon hybrid!Tommy,1
Dave | Technoblade & Tommyinnit are siblings,1
Raccoon!Tommy,1
Techno‚Äôs voices,1
They thought tommy was dead,1
hybrid techno,1
hybrid tommy,1
I think I mean I'm just fleshing out their dynamic ngl,1
They're gonna be family but OH IT IS A HILL,1
they are fambly tho,1
one day he'll get it,1
dream gets vibe checked,1
spoiler: he failed,1
Tommy is a vegan necromancer,1
Tommy is straight up not having a good time,1
Techno is somehow the patron god of a cult,1
hyped to be able to use that tag,1
its soft i swear,1
canon refuses to feed us,1
so I make my own brotherly dynamic,1
Techno is a wandering mercenary,1
Tommy just wants a family again,1
Ranboo and TommyInnit friendship,1
why isn't that a tag already,1
he's like 6,1
but Techno thinks he's 4 cause he smoll,1
Via Dragon Instincts,1
It's there for like 1 line,1
Clay | Dream Has PTSD (Video Blogging RPF),1
Clay | Dream Has Panic Attacks (Video Blogging RPF),1
Mentioned hybrid discrimination,1
Tommy never visited Pandora's Vault,1
not beta read its 2am,1
more tubbo!,1
might update these tags idk,1
Platonic possessiveness,1
....dw about those tags its fiiiiine,1
author went ham on world building for no reason,1
i cant believe i fucking forgot that one HOW,1
a twist on Tommy‚Äôs golden apple addiction,1
set before the January 6th stream,1
Technoblade is (unfortunately) merely a family friend,1
Technoblade POV - Freeform,1
pt1 is Pulse Lite pt2 is the extended version,1
Techno is a family friend but he considers sbi as family,1
the chat makes an appearance a few times,1
Sad Philza Minecraft,1
Technoblade is Suffering,1
it's soft just read it i suck at summaries,1
its more implied,1
Blanket Permission Statement,1
Platonic Possesive,1
its not kidnapping if you called dibs,1
not very graphic but it's there,1
no beta we die like punz,1
Yes this is why he is in character tags,1
I need to complete my PUNZ IS GONE challenge,1
its more hybrid instincts but ao3 tags am I right?,1
not really but kinda?,1
it‚Äôs all wholesome I swear,1
I‚Äôm sorry Philza enjoyers,1
but it had to be done,1
I once again put Tommy through it,1
but there‚Äôs a lot of fluff this time so it‚Äôs ok right?,1
For a while. He gets a bit older.,1
I mean basically,1
they're all children,1
IT WAS JUST MEANT TO BE FLUFF DAMN YOU,1
no beta reader we die like my readers do when I don‚Äôt update tlyitds,1
by minor I mean incredibly painful but healed by the end of the fic and there‚Äôs no stabbing,1
The goverment is corrupt,1
Heroes are Corrupt,1
"But in like ""He commits murder for his loved ones""",1
not the possesive type,1
Electrocution,1
but no one dies from that,1
Everyone is in the story,1
everyone is a knight,1
techno is a bro,1
caught kissing,1
the whole palace knows and no one is surprised,1
Ending is chaos,1
Kinda I mean I THINK,1
Technoblade doesn't have a heart but that's okay Tommy will be his heart,1
Tommy is his humanity,1
He's also his accidental son but EHHHH,1
he's super minor though don't worry,1
he's there for like two seconds,1
yes this was partially inspired by Voltron leave me alone,1
Tommy gets adopted by an alternate universe,1
Platonic Beeduo Marriage,1
That's AE!Emerald Duo,1
they are platonically married your honor,1
that one is also for the AE!Emerald Duo,1
and technically DSMP!Emerald Duo but they're kinda asses in this fic,1
Bad Technoblade,1
Good Technoblade,1
several actually,1
and cuddles,1
good techno and phil skip the 'get to know you' and go straight into adoption,1
bc im tired and honestly don't want to write all that,1
but i also desperatley want to write the au,1
maybe ill edit it later,1
no i wonr,1
we all know i wont,1
google docs is my beta,1
damn this is a lot of tags now that i'm lookin at this,1
ALSO OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE CHARACTERS NOT THE CONTENT CREATORS,1
JUST THOUGHT I'D SPECIFY THAT AGAIN,1
he took one look at tommy and adopted him,1
everytime i update the tags get longer istg,1
Hacker!Tommy,1
(if you could call it that),1
minor body horror/gore descriptions?,1
or rather discontinued with the wip ending posted,1
thanks for everything techno and fans,1
Everybody was writing such good techno and tommy content and i wanted to join,1
so here you go,1
But Like For Hybrids,1
Kind of...,1
It's More Like A Bad Situation That They Deal With As Best As They Can,1
not really but he gives off the vibes for a hot minute,1
he's 5-7,1
Hibernating Technoblade (Video Blogging RPF),1
A lot actually,1
because techno has no idea what gender tommy is at first,1
he's a little gremlin,1
Tommy is a Prime devout and Techno respects that,1
he does not respect his freedom,1
Bedrockbros bonding time,1
conversations about faith,1
Obligatory: this is about the characters not the cc,1
is usually a hero-story thing but please,1
respect Techno's terrible and awkward attempts at remembering how mortals work,1
But no new archive warnings,1
Past/background Crimeboys,1
identity shenanigans are fun identity reveals less so,1
but in spirit,1
shhh it‚Äôs a secret,1
kinda not really tho,1
Hybirds,1
Pufferfish TommyInnit,1
(I don't know if a tag has ever been more true),1
In the past!!! Not anymore!!!! This fic is about healing!!!!,1
Copious Amounts of Sun Tzu,1
so I've been told,1
jealousblade,1
It's really hybrid instincts but shhh,1
Dream sucks in this one sorry,1
Tommy is a warrior with plot armor and you know what good for him,1
This is written so dramatically but then again it's midnight,1
So really that's not my fault,1
Based off my thread on twitter of Tommy being watched over by three gods,1
on his journey to be a warrior,1
Hot Springs & Onsen,1
Make Phil's tag not his name challenge,1
Techno is a Dragon,1
Brotherblade vibes,1
"Tommy is like ""I'm going to kill you!""",1
"and Techno goes ""oh god that's a child""",1
