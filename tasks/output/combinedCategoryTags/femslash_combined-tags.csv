just Kara being an awkward bi dork and Lena trying to play it cool,1
Eventual Kara/Lena,1
(some violence early on but not graphic or violent enough to warrant a warning),1
it was meant to be slow burn but it got real gay real fast,1
for about 4 seconds,1
Same universe sort of,1
they're totally in love,1

(a completely inaccessible and rightfully guarded billionaire she‚Äôs literally just met),1
Kara Danvers tries to focus that energy on doing her actual dream job,1
a noble goal which goes right out the window,1
