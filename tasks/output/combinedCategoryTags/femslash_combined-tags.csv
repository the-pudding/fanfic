they're so in love i'm going to cry,1
i swear there's a happy ending but it's a slow burn so you've gotta earn it,1
i intended for this to be angsty,1

Only Tommy knows because he was there when it happened,1
They told literally no one else though,1
Fuck communication am I right,1
there are other characters mentioned but they get mentioned like once,1

in which lena ABSOLUTELY understands that supergirl's lips are prime real estate,1
in which lena pays a completely reasonable amount of money to kiss kara (for charity!),1

the smut got wildly out of hand,1
like im talking WILDLY,1

Deaf Lena Luthor,1
kara danvers is a personified puppy,1
Forced Cohabitation,1
there were negotiations,1
KARA JUST WANTS TO KEEP LENA ALIVE OKAY,1
just Kara being an awkward bi dork and Lena trying to play it cool,1
Eventual Kara/Lena,1
(some violence early on but not graphic or violent enough to warrant a warning),1
it was meant to be slow burn but it got real gay real fast,1
for about 4 seconds,1
Same universe sort of,1
they're totally in love,1
some danvers sisters,1
Hint of Sanvers,1
Anxious Kara,1
Repressed Lesbian Lena Luthor,1
No Mon El/Kara in here sry,1
smut is on chapter 12 FYI ;),1

Lena needs a hug always,1
secret reveal,1
Lillian Luthor was a shitty mom in case anybody was still wondering,1
Lena may or may not have a crush on Joanna Gaines,1
or a belly rub,1

lena is getting a reputation,1
bruce wayne is helping her,1
it's crack,1
lena dating everyone but kara,1
Danvers sisters bonding,1
Alex finds out Kara is dating Lena,1
this is pretty much just shameless kinky supercorp tbh,1
oh and a really brief mention of,1
like 5+1 things but 4+1 things,1
it's childhood best friends to lovers,1
aka best trope ever,1
Mathematicians,1
There will be some karamel but only so I can tear them apart and make Kara come to her senses,1
too much chocolate,1
Kara can speak more than one language,1
aliens and humans openly co-exist,1
Alternate Universe - Post College,1
kara is not a hero,1
lena is a potty mouth,1
rated for mild cursing,1
also some typical soft lena sadness,1
and gets a bunch because i said so,1
Alex is a good sister,1
and makes a reasonable conclusion based on limited information,1
and incorrectly assumes that kara and lena aren’t fucking idiots,1
remember when lena joked about dansen adopting her in 6x20,1
this fic takes that very seriously,1
legit 70 percent of ch1 is just alex adopting her,1
canon compliant (derogatory),1
starts in early s6 but will end post-canon,1
ch2 update: it’s technically been a six-year slowburn,1
