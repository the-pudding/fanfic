anthropomorphic inanimate objects,1
several unsuccessful suicides but such is the nature of being the master of death,1

Though then Tony could tell Thor "That's rough buddy",1
father-teacup relationship,1
Crossover Pairings,1
Crack Crossover,1
Bruce Wayne Adopts Orphans,1
the author has daddy issues and takes it out on her favourite characters,1
it's somehow comic-cannon,1

Aunt May is a badass,1

even if that person is Captain America,1

Street-level heroes are the best heroes,1
Nelson and Murdock forever,1

rocks up two years late with starbucks -- ''hey y'all want a field trip fic?'',1
Peter's classmates find out that Peter was NOT lying about the internship,1
(AFFECTIONATE),1
Tony would like to have lab minions All Of The Time please,1
the whole ''peter's not allowed on field trips'' thing is GREAT in Tony's opinion,1
he would like it to keep being a thing,1
Homecoming compliant,1
(fuck endgame),1
(in this house we don't aknowledge endgame),1
also - Harley is 17 and on a gap year in this,1
he graduated high school a year early and was lined up for MIT,1
and tony offered him a year's worth of work experience first,1
tony's done the ''underage attendance at college'' thing and he doesnt recommend it,1
so Harley's doing a year of SI interning and then MIT at 18,1
The avengers think Peter is Tony's biological son,1
Peter and Tony decide to go with it,1
What's Infinity War and Endgame? I don't know them. I only know happiness.,1

Nick and peter lowkey becoming reluctant friends is my favorite trope.,1
Peter "Im an adult source trust me bro" Parker,1
and then everyone just believes him,1
in which peter actually comes before the avengers,1
they're confused too bc technically this 15 year old has been doing this wayyy longer than them,1
They don't like it,1
i love it,1
once again utilizing the denny's trope,1
Harry Osborn is a Good Friend,1
dont let the chapter titles fool you this shit could fuck you up lmaoo,1

if you dont want him to literally be eating everyone up,1
then this is not the one for you babe,1
Shameless Peter whump,1
descriptions of injuries,1
Nobody knows Spider-Man's identity,1
but oh boy are they gonna find out,1
Peter is fourteen,1
teenage for language,1
wow that's a lot of fixes,1
this author is still bitter about the events of CA:CW,1
basically i love tony stark,1
and this fic is him going round fixing shit,1
adopting kids,1
getting a little revenge,1
and preventing Thanos from happening,1
earth's best defender bitches,1
