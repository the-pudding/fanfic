these boys are messy,1
so is their relationship,1
the emotional dynamic is the opposite of the physical one,1
I'm not telling you which one of them wears the collar,1
(but one of them does),1
draco's not some redeemed angel in this,1
he's flawed and damaged like the rest of them,1
(probably more so),1
(but hey not everyone had Voldemort and his band of psychos come to their house for sleepovers),1
draco suffers from 'ooh shiny!' syndrome,1
(we're going with: wizards don't know how to treat ADHD),1
(seems legit bc Muggles suck at it too),1

Teddy is here also,1
His occupation is godson and he is excelling,1
Harry's a good godfather,1
He's also going through the horrors,1
Harry's like the surly dad that refuses to care about the new cat,1
but he's the one who ends up loving the cat the most,1
(Draco is the cat in this metaphor),1
Draco is a Control Freak,1
which is saying a lot for a man who never knows what's going on,1
Draco is oblivious while Harry's not the best at feelings,1
so they've got their work cut out for them,1
Harry and Draco have no sense of boundaries with one another,1
Men will create intricate rituals just to see their mortal enemy,1
they do in fact communicate,1
im not saying they do it well,1
