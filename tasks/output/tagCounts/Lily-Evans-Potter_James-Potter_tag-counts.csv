you'll definitely want to kill Lily and me by the middle of this,1
and I won't even be angry about it because you'll be right to want to kill me,1
also I'm not tagging the smut chapter anymore because I keep combining chapters in edits and fuck it,1
I was advised to tag this heavy angst,1
so I'm tagging it heavy angst,1
but it does have a happy ending I swear,1
I confirmed it on tumblr if you don't believe me,1
people keep asking me because this is so angsty and no one believes,1
it has a happy ending,1
I SWEAR TO GOD IT DOES,1

Top/bottom versatile James and Severus,1
just FYI there won't be fixed top/bottom dynamics between James and Sev -they will switch,1
this is not a morality fable where characters get punished for their sins,1
James did bad things. Lily did bad things. Sev did bad things. I stan a morally problematic polycule,1
they will continue to Do Bad Things (but FOR each other instead of TO each other),1
Sev forgiving or letting things slide that he shouldn't bc he's profoundly lonely/affection-starved,1

he calls dumbledore's bullshit out on multiple occasions,1
he's not taking Any Shit this time around,1
he is determined to get his way no matter what,1
and guess what,1
it always works,1
anyway,1
dont get your hopes up for a completed story this is just for funsies :'),1
it's the longest thing i've ever written and i'm proud of it but i know it is Subpar,1
harry definitely doesn't have the emotional reactions he should but just pretend they're there,1
this is a lot of dialogue,1
relationships will probably not be developed properly but i am trying my best,1
it will not be a very good romance story but it'll be a story nonetheless so,1
characters will be ooc this cannot be avoided,1
i am incapable of writing a character that is fully in character,1
very fast paced in the first seven chapters,1
i needed to get to a point i was more comfortable writing about,1
