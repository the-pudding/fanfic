wei wuxian's single brain cell,1
So much kissing,1
wei ying is embarassed,1
and then he gets mad,1
ranting out 13 years worth anger,1
but also canon divergent,1
in an alternate universe though,1
mostly wwx confusing the kids,1

its mild,1
does it count as drama,1

is he internally screaming,1
i guess although its more like internal crying,1
but only very slight angst,1
Holidays,1
the inherent emotional tension of staying at a difficult family member's house over a major holiday,1
for like the first time ever someone besides Wei Wuxian actually succeeds at killing Wei Wuxian,1
now historically killing Wei Wuxian without Wei Wuxian’s active participation,1
has proven to be a tricky proposition but here we go,1
killing Wei Wuxian has made a lot of people very angry and is widely being regarded as a bad move,1
WWX: I made necromancy look cool and now all the kids are doing it,1
Wen Qing: what—like it’s hard?,1
Jiang Cheng shouts,1
he is a godsend,1
if you ever need a character to just yell the thing,1
Jiang Cheng is available for your shouting needs,1
Jin Zixuan: the least objectionable of all the Jins,1
jiang cheng is getting like all of the best comedy lines in this story,1
it is his secret birthright,1
somehow ‘Wei Wuxian died at Qiongqi Path’ went from being the central premise of this story,1
to being a thinly veiled excuse for Jiang Cheng to yell at people who look funny at his brother,1
no regrets tbh,1
References to anxiety,1
basically a fix-it fic,1
fixing everything that went wrong,1
or attempt to,1
everyone who died retains their memory,1
things are going to go right this time because I said so,1
There's more characters,1
I'll add the prominent ones as I mention them,1
happy fic,1
(I'm basing some elements from spoilers I've seen around),1
(I haven't read the whole novel),1
warning: may cause feels and tears,1
it was supposed to be happy but then fixing the relationships brings up issues apparently,1
