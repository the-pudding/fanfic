in which lena ABSOLUTELY understands that supergirl's lips are prime real estate,1
in which lena pays a completely reasonable amount of money to kiss kara (for charity!),1
possibly the gayest reason to use 'a super and a luthor working together',1
i know what you're thinking: anna wdym you wrote something that's not filthy and smutty?,1
