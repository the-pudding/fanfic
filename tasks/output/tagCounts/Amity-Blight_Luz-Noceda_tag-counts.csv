this fic explores amity's pov in that time where theyre not out to camila,1
camila realises amity has a crush on luz,1
well... we'll see how that goes,1
Inspired by MoringMark's The Owl House Comics,1
It's so minor i'm not even sure it counts,1
Listen i know luz is oblivious to her crush on amity but not after this,1
Don't think it's fully abuse but there's some weird stuff going on with the blight parents,1
Her mom especially,1
So just to be on the safe side,1
They're going to be in love someday,1
What am i supposed to tag with this,1
She gets a little less oblivious i promise,1
