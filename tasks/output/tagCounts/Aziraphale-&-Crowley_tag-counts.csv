there's a wound there but nothing is graphic there's just some blood in the first chapter,1
YEAH they're friends who would die for each other even if they can't admit it at this point in canon,1
they can't say it out loud but they can still discover some things right? right,1
they have so many misconceptions about each other and they're getting shattered in this fic,1
there's not much plot for a 33k fic we just sit in their heads for the whole time,1
this happens several years before the scene where crowley asks for holy water,1
and it's canon compliant so yeah...,1
the ending is a bit bittersweet tbh,1
but i hope it provides a nice explanation for their behavior in 1862,1
(it's because they care about each other So Much),1
