he's not /really/ a villain /technically/,1
more like a kind of jackass antihero with zero morals who happens to be on the hpsc payroll,1
not... legally,1
but like she calls him dad,1
its prob the most wholesome thing in this entire dumpsterfire of gore and angst,1
haha lets just add a little,1
for good measure,1
he starts out bad but then,1
happens so the LoV is good for one (1) thing,1
one for all is the friend that's always down for murder,1
