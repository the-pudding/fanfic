Kirk and Spock, Bucky and Captain America, Castiel and Dean, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, are each the object of homoerotic fantasy. Men are shipped across every pairing, regardless of their sexualities or relationship to each other in the source material.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Slash ships, or same-sex relationships between men, are far and away the most popular type of fanfic on Ao3.</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">     </div> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">     </div> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">The increase in non-romantic fanfiction in recent years can be mostly attributed to the rise in popularity of video game vloggers on YouTube, which we discuss in the real person fiction section!</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Our analysis shows that slash fic has been over twice as popular as the next category of fanfic since at least 2013. However, despite the overwhelming popularity of same-sex relationships between men, the writers and consumers of fanfics are overwhelmingly not gay men.</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">     </div> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">     </div> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">According to a 2024 demographic survey of Ao3 users by centreoftheselights, only 2.5% of respondents identify as cisgender men, and 12.8% identify as straight, which points to an overwhelming readership of women, nonbinary, and queer individuals.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">This begs the question – what explains the fascination with gay male relationships?</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Decades of existing fan fiction scholarship and our analysis of 10 years of Ao3 data point to several possibly contributing factors.</p> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>Men love fandom (The history of fan fiction and genre)</h3> </div><div class="full-chart svelte-1l991r9"><figure data-svelte-h="svelte-1v9vomq"></figure> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Fan fiction authors often write about fandoms whose characters are already dominated by men. As seen from the Top 20 fandoms on Ao3, the main cast of the original media is TKTKTK.</p> </div><div class="full-chart svelte-1l991r9"><figure data-svelte-h="svelte-1v9vomq"></figure> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">You might also notice that these heavily men-dominated fandoms all fall into the same genres: TK, TK, TK, TK, TK— groupings that historically have had predominantly fanbases of men. This can potentially be traced back to the origins of fandom itself — science fiction.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Quick history lesson: In the 1920’s, the science fiction only magazine Amazing Stories by Hugo Gernsback gave birth to participatory fandom culture in America. The magazine included a column that allowed readers to publish pieces with their mailing addresses, encouraging correspondence between fans and authors. The community, which consisted of mostly teenage boys, evolved into fanzines and conventions where boys exchanged analyses on science fiction literature.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">When Star Trek, the TV show, premiered in 1967, it instantly tapped into an already existing science fiction fan base of men. According to Henry Jenkins’s 1992 essay “Textual Poachers”, the existing close relationships between authors and fans “created barriers to female fans, and this fandom’s traditions resisted inflection or redefinition.” To make the fandom their own, women began to transform and reimagine the Star Trek universe by editing clips from the show and writing what we now know as fan fiction. Thus was born the iconic Kirk/Spock slash pairing that served as the framework for generations of slash to come.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Now, fanfiction is still concentrated around science fiction and other men-centric fandoms because the culture originated from those spaces. It’s a bit of a “what came first, the chicken or the egg?” scenario. The fandoms with the largest communities attract fanfic writers to their universes, but are often dominated by characters and writers who are men. Thus, fandoms that authors write about are often dominated by men.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">However, part of the appeal of these genres for authors is that they allow them to flip the script. Non-male authors state that they write into and around these fandoms to subvert the heteronormative, straight mainstream perspective.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Authors often read platonic relationships in the source material as only being platonic because they are in societies and settings that are hostile towards homosexual relationships, but would be canon otherwise.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Fanfiction authors organize themselves around genres that are male-dominated both in source material and in fandom culture, due to their communities and potential for subversion, which leads to more slash fics.</p> </div><div class="quote"><p>Through genre, internalized machismo or homophobia which make it hard for M/M relationships to exist, which makes it more interesting for authors to subvert.</p> <p>undefined</p> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>Fictional women are aliens</h3> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Female characters are fetishized in the majority of media.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Since popular culture is catered to the “male gaze,” women struggle to identify with women on screen. Characters are often white, skinny, hyper-feminized, and lack agency, which alienates fans looking to escape through characters they can relate to. These characters feel foreign, and writing and reading about them heightens feelings of intrasexual competition. Slash fic allows non-male authors and readers to identify with either character in a ship pairing</p> </div><div class="quote"><p>Male fans “do not feel the need to transform the fictional worlds they are offered because they are their prime target: the point-of-view characters are more often than not straight white men, the sexually objectified characters tend to be young women, and men tend to have more lines and more agency in general”</p> <p>undefined</p> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Women write fewer fics involving female characters because they are often portrayed in the source media in a way that clash with their existing sense of self, making it safer to write about men. We can casually test this theory by sampling a few of the top fandoms.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">In Harry Potter, the original media contains a few relatively well-written women. There are still comparatively more men in the main cast, but there are also a smattering of F/M ships.</p> </div><div class="full-chart svelte-1l991r9"><figure data-svelte-h="svelte-1v9vomq"></figure> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">In comparison, Marvel Universe, which historically sexualized its female characters in both the comics and the cinematic universe. However, even despite the larger percentage of female characters in the universe, M/M ships are far more popular than in the Harry Potter universe.</p> </div><div class="full-chart svelte-1l991r9"><figure data-svelte-h="svelte-1v9vomq"></figure> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>The Female gaze</h3> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">If popular culture is the “male gaze,” fanfic is the “female gaze.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Since both partners are the same gender in slash fic, authors are able to imagine relationships that lack ingrained and stereotypical gender dynamics. Women struggle to envision themselves in heterosexual relationships where there is complete mutual respect. Slash fic evens the playing field, so to speak, giving both parties mutual power and mutual respect. Authors can subvert the societal expectations that burden straight relationships and project whatever romantic dynamic they want to see or experience themselves.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Going back to the original science fiction ship, Kirk/Spock, TKTK writes that the fact that they are men is not incredibly relevant to the fantasy. The fact that Spock is technically an alien demonstrates that slash ships are not about fetishizing gay male relationships, but rather provide an androgynous template to work from.</p> </div><div class="quote"><p>“his alienness is a way of “coding” into the K/S fantasies that their subject is not a homosexual love affair between two men, but love and sex as women want them, whether with a man or with another woman.”</p> <p>undefined</p> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Queer female authors enjoy seeing men vulnerable. Slash fics endow men, despite portraying none of these qualities in the source media, with oodles of emotional vulnerability, allowing them to fulfill a role that authors wish they would encounter in their own lives.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">The romance in fics also often progresses much slower than in popular media, filled with yearning and drama, and a single fic is often hundreds of thousands of words long. The most popular tags for fics on ao3 across the board consistently emphasize how relationships progress.</p> </div><div class="full-chart svelte-1l991r9"><figure data-svelte-h="svelte-1v9vomq"></figure> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Notice the top themes, such as hurt/comfort, Fluff and Angst, slow burn, soul mates. The desire to see these patterns can be traced back to how women are socialized in society – to not initiate sex, to go slow with relationships, to be nurturing, to be fulfilled by utter, complete monogamy. Women are guided by what Russ calls the “sexualization of the female condition”. These features in fanfic – the external factors that push people together, the endless pain and comforting – are sexualized, and it’s exciting to see that portrayed by men, who are socialized in the opposite ways.</p> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>Men are hot</h3> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">People attracted to men like to read and write and fantasize about hot men.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">If we begin to split the tag data by relationship types, M/M, F/M, and F/F, we start to see different types of tags emerge in the Top 20 for each category.</p> </div><div class="full-chart svelte-1l991r9"><figure data-svelte-h="svelte-1v9vomq"></figure> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">While there are many tags that overlap across the groups, there are many more tags related to sexual acts for slash fics than for straight or femslash ships.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Once we filter out the overlaps so we get the top 100 unique tags from each relationship type, these differences become even sharper.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Authors enjoy shipping characters because they’re attractive and they want to see them together. This is especially clear in the disparity in the quantity of romantic and sexual fanfic of boy and girl K-pop bands, which is discussed more in the RPF section.</p> </div><div class="quote"><p>"the seemingly unradical notion that many women find men attractive, and therefore like looking at them, particularly without their clothes on"</p> <p>undefined</p> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Much of slash fic is indeed pornographic.

Authors also often change(CITE, TKTK, fan studies reader), mistake to think they are one person. But, hopefully this sheds some light onto some of the potential reasons why slash fascinates us all.</p> </div> </section><section id="noncanon-slide" class="svelte-1l991r9"><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Dean Winchester and Castiel:</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Two men (one human, one angel) working together to fight supernatural forces of evil.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Or, according to 100,000 works of fanfiction on Ao3: two souls destined to find love amidst the chaos, transcending the boundaries between heaven, hell, and earth to be together.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">For shippers of “Destiel” (that’s the shipping portmanteau of ‘Dean’ and ‘Castiel’), the wait was a long one. Initially introduced as a minor character in Season 4 of Supernatural, Castiel’s appearance would go on to spawn one of the biggest ships in internet history, building a legacy of fanfiction, art, video edits, zines, songs, theories, discussions, and conventions, all dedicated to exploring the rich subtext simmering beneath the surface between the two characters.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Like many other popular slash pairings in media, the romantic and sexual undertones that may or may not have existed between the lines were generally understood by fans to be “non-canon.” ‘Non-canon’ broadly describes any ship, setting, plot, or other elements of the story that are not explicitly confirmed in the source material, but exist as alternative possibilities that fans can flesh out through fanfiction and other creative means. Those three seconds when Dean’s gaze seemed to linger on Castiel’s face? That’s inspiration for a 20,000 word romantic fic right there, regardless of what the scene originally meant to convey.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Ever since the Kirk/Spock days, fans have been drawn to ships that exist beyond the canon of the original material. Non-canon ships make up the overwhelming majority of pairings on Ao3, accounting for nearly twice as many ships that exist canonically.</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">    <h3>TKTKTK</h3> <div class="chart-container svelte-rf2o3c"> </div> </div> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">[Annotation: When tagging each ship with their canon status, we referred to fanlore, wikis, Tumblr posts, and more to try and distill the general fandom sentiment into one of the three categories. We acknowledge that this process is inherently subjective and that interpretations may vary.]</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Of course, what counts as “‘canon”’ and “‘non-canon”’ can vary over the course of the story’s run. Destiel spent twelve years as a non-canon, largely fandom-driven ship until Castiel confessed his love for Dean before dying in the final episodes of Season 15, thus acknowledging their long, storied relationship as a semi-canonically romantic one—and blowing up the internet as a result.</p> </div><div class="quote"><p>y'all realise how big this is? spn finally making destiel canon on their final season? breaking twitter and tumblr? the longest slow burn to ever slow burn??? the old fans returning??? the old accounts reviving??? in the middle of a pandemic?? in the middle of THE US ELECTION????</p> <p>undefined</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">     </div> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">This question of canonicity has long been a subject of contention. In the early A.D.s, religious leaders clashed over conflicting interpretations of the Bible (from which the term “‘canon”’ is derived from). In the 19th Ccentury, scholars scrutinized and debated the authorship of Shakespeare’s body of works. And in the internet age, fans spam gifs and think pieces at each other in a battle to prove which ship is more real. Ask any big fandom and they’ll probably be able to point you to the still-smoldering crater of some ship argument that invoked canonicity (or lack thereof) as a metric of superiority.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Given this endlessly recurring debate, it’s thus worth asking: Why are people way more invested in non-canon content than in the established canon?</p> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>Transformative storytelling</h3> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Fanfiction as wish fulfillment.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">As we’ve established in the slash section, there are a myriad of historical and societal reasons why fandoms tend to be dominated by slash ships. This trend is compounded by the fact that many of these ships are not canonical, meaning that there are often little to no explicit signs of any romantic relationship ever occurring between the two characters in the source material. As a result, fans have plenty of room to speculate, fantasize, and expand on the dynamic of their favorite characters precisely because of, rather than despite, the lack of romantic interaction.</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">     </div> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Subtext is the key factor here. Canon relationships are often bound to typical romance arcs that play out in conventional trajectories: the steamy “enemies to lovers”, the playful “will they or won’t they”, or the classic “happily ever after”, to name just a few. When writers work in elements like jealous misunderstandings or meaningful glances, they expect the audience to pick up on and follow the progression of this romance. It’s a predictable cue—not necessarily a bad one by any means, but certainly frequent and familiar in media.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">But what happens when the audiences flip the script and impose these cues on the canon instead, subverting the intended narrative?</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">This experience then becomes transformative. Instead of adhering to the formulated storylines, fans can instead use the source material as a “springboard for [their] own creative and analytical work”, pushing past the boundaries of the canon to reimagine new narratives. A quiet, fleeting moment between two characters can be reinterpreted as intimate. A heated confrontation between the hero and her enemy can become sexually charged. Such is the freedom of fanfiction: fans have the agency to interact with the story as if it were “a tangible place they can inhabit and explore.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">For queer audiences, a relationship that appears unromantic on screen but hints at a deeper emotional subtext under the surface may hit particularly close to home. Furthermore, rooting for a ship that you know will likely never materialize in the text also means not having to brace for the fallout of said relationship—no messy breakups, tragic endings, or unrealistic portrayals that often accompany queer relationships in mainstream media (The 100 famously killed off fan-favorite character Lexa right after she has sex with Clarke, sparking a wave of scrutiny against the Bury Your Gays trope).</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">In this context, the ambiguity and open-endedness of these relationships allow fans to explore possibilities that go unaddressed and unfulfilled in the original text, without the risk of them being mishandled or cut short by the writers. Fans come together as a fandom to swap theories, validate observations, share headcanons, and fill in the narrative gaps, forming a community where queerness is celebrated, studied, and foregrounded in a media landscape where it often lacks the attention or respect it deserves.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">While the allure of non-canon dynamics isn’t exclusive to slash ships (Mulder and Scully from The X Files famously remained as ‘just coworkers’ for seven entire seasons, which in turn fueled the Sculder ‘relationshippers’, as they were originally called back then), there’s a noticeable lack of them amongst the top femslash and het ships.</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">     </div> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">This can be attributed to several reasons. Rarely does a mainstream show feature multiple female characters who are both complex and interact within a shared narrative (as contemporaries, partners, rivals, etc.), and even when they do, it’s easy to pass off intimate interactions between women as platonic rather than romantic. Furthermore, female characters are more likely to be paired up with a partner or have their relationship status serve as a central plot point in their arc, often at the expense of developing deep connections with other characters.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">However, while the rate of non-canon ships has remained steady for slash and het pairings, there has been a significant increase of non-canon femslash ships over the past decade. Kara Danvers/Lena Luthor and Regina Mills/Emma Swan are two examples of a long-running femslash ship that features a rich, tense, and complex dynamic between two female characters. Perhaps this is a welcome sign that female relationships in popular media are finally getting their due.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Non-canon ships offer fans a creative outlet to explore relationships that are traditionally underrepresented in media, but their popularity may also encourage producers to exploit fan interest without actually providing meaningful representation on screen.</p> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>Queerbaiting = profit</h3> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">You may have noticed that most of these top ships feature characters whose sexualities are either established or treated by the canon as straight.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Often, the queering that happens in fanfiction isn’t just in the fans’ heads. Productions from ‘Sherlock’ all the way to ‘Frozen’ have been called out for incorporating character traits, dialogue, or narratives that allude to queerness but stop short of delivering genuine representation, allowing producers to capitalize off the buzz without alienating mainstream audiences and, more crucially, their money.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">[Quote: Queerbaiting is a practice whereby producers incorporate queer subtexts into a show in the hope of expanding the audience by attracting LGBTQ+ folk while avoiding alienating viewers who would disapprove of openly queer characters.] Neville, Girls Who Like Boys Who Like Boys</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Check out Netflix’s promo for Wednesday: an Addams-family themed drag party titled WednesGay and an ‘opposites attract’ tweet about Wednesday and her roommate-turned-friend Enid.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Or these videos by Teen Wolf actors Dylan O’Brien (who plays Stiles) and Tyler Hoechlin (who plays Derek) calling for fans to vote for the show in the 2012 Teen Choice Awards while embracing in suggestive poses (Teen Wolf won Choice Summer TV Show that year).</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Or Disney’s live-action remake of the Beauty and the Beast, which made headlines for featuring the “first LGBTQ character in Disney’s history” only for it to amount to a two-second blink-and-you-miss-it scene of LeFou dancing with an extra.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">The common thread? Each example is a token gesture aimed at appealing to queer fanbases for marketing and promotion purposes, ‘baiting’ fans with promises of queer content to drive engagement.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Meanwhile, queer-led shows are facing increasing cancellations as networks continue to slash promising productions after just one or two seasons. Shows about queer women are even more vulnerable to cancellation despite logging high viewership, ratings, and fan support.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">While the popularity of non-canon ships can be attributed to wish fulfillment and fantasy, it also points to infrastructural issues stemming from the overrepresentation of the straight male experience in mainstream media. Fans project onto these characters because there are simply more of them and they’ve been around for longer, benefitting from well-established tropes, greater attention, thriving fandom spaces, and richer development, in contrast with the often short-lived and underdeveloped stories about queer and female characters.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Sometimes, these non-canon ships draw more attention than queer ships that canonically exist in the show, and may especially overshadow queer characters of color.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Just take a look at this breakdown.</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">     </div> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">While this skew in ship popularity does reflect fandom trends and preferences on Ao3, it more importantly reveals broader patterns of bias in mainstream media and underscores the extensive impact of privileging certain experiences over others.</p> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>Alternate Universes</h3> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Aside from relationships, subverting the canon can also mean transforming other elements of the story. Writers can transpose characters into new settings to explore how they would exist in a different environment, like mashing multiple fandoms together (think Harry Potter in the Avengers universe with Percy Jackson as his rival) or throwing them three thousand years back in time. It’s the ultimate practice of ‘what if?’, one that allows writers and readers to reimagine and reinterpret their favorite stories over and over in fresh and exciting ways.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Fans can also use these ‘alternate universes’ as a vehicle to ask “speculative and reflective questions about their own lives.” Rather than writing about the inner workings of a spaceship or the complicated political web of a medieval kingdom, they can use fandom and fanfiction to explore deeply personal questions that may be difficult to process without that layer of fictionalization.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">It may be easier to strike up a conversation with other fans about a trans Hermione Granger, for example, or an aged Peter Parker who feels lost and without purpose, than to share personal anxieties like they’re ripped straight out of a diary page with other people.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Our data shows that nearly half of the top 20 AU tags indicate mundane settings like ‘high school’ and ‘coffee shops’. Many of these tags also transpose extraordinary characters into ordinary circumstances, with tags like ‘‘human’, ‘no powers’, ‘muggle’, and ‘non-magical’.</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">     </div> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Ultimately, the fascination with non-canon fanfiction speaks to the interplay between creators, fans, and the story itself. It’s an old practice—older than the internet, at least—but as long as stories continue to inspire people to imagine new possibilities, it looks like this one is here to stay.</p> </div> </section><section id="realpeople-slide" class="svelte-1l991r9"><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Harry Styles and Jeon Jungkook:</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Two of the biggest boy band birthed pop stars on the planet.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Or, according to over 200,000 works of fanfiction on Ao3: two enigmatic vocalists having their sexual awakening with their fellow boy bandmates.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Often we think of fanfic fandom as moving in one direction: from the pages of the internet to the “real world,” ala E.L. James’ original Twilight fanfic to “50 Shades of Grey” to suburban mom book club favorite.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">But the opposite also happens: real people become characters in fictional 100 chapter sagas. It’s the ultimate rewriting of “life imitates art” into “art imitating life.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Over the last 10 years, roughly 11% of the fanfiction on Ao3 has been reserved for this type of storytelling, or Real Person Fiction (RPF), but there has been some notable shifts in the relationship type and canon status of RPF on Ao3.</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper"><h3>Percentage of ships that are RPF</h3> <div class="chart-container svelte-v2jk8">   </div>     </div> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Like all of fanfiction, RPF heavily skews slash (M/M) and non-canon, but even more so. Slash fics make up 65% of all fanfic on Ao3 compared to 88% of RPF, while non-canon fics account for ~65% of all fanfic, but ~90% of RPF.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">The list of top RPF ships (all slash and all non-canon) reads like a Spotify playlist, with some YouTube and television content sprinkled in. Sixteen out of the Top 20 are boy bands (or bands of all boys).</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">   <h3>Top 20 romantic RPF ships</h3> <figure class="svelte-1qi48fu"><table class="svelte-1qi48fu"></table> </figure>  </div> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>Headline here</h3> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">If it were the 1960s we’d be slash shipping the Beatles’ John Lennon/Paul McCartney. And, in the 1990s New Kids on the Block’s Jordan Knight/Joey McIntyre would be the “it” ship. So why are boy bands tailor made for romantic reinventions?</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">In her book “Larger Than Life: A History of Boy Bands from NKOTB to BTS,” author Maria Sherman explains that boy bands embody a softer, more innocent masculinity that enables fans to safely experiment beyond traditional identity and desire, and to swivel between romantic types.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Because boy bands exist through a “female gaze” (opposite of much of the world), Sherman theorizes that “[boy bands] dare not to uphold straight cis men’s interest, but to celebrate marginalized people’s humanity.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Although this theory doesn’t always work for the band members themselves — think *NSYNC’s Lance Bass hiding his sexuality to uphold a stereotypical masculinity — it does hold true for fans’ interpretations: the queer women who can’t decide if they want to be Harry Styles or be with him, the drag kings who interpret the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way” to be about anal sex, and of course the ever growing amount of RPF.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Boys in fanfic are quite literally stuck in the phase before they become Boyz II Men.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Although much of popular fanfic is dictated by what is happening in the “outside” or “real” world, with M/M RPF there also might be a bit of a “Peter Pan” effect, where boys can essentially age out of the fanfare. Consider this “passing of the torch” from One Direction to BTS over the last 10 years.</p> </div><div class="inline-chart svelte-1l991r9"><div class="chart-wrapper">    <h3>RPF fandoms with over 10,000 fanfics over time</h3> <div class="chart-container svelte-rf2o3c"> </div> </div> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">The other meteoric rise is this chart is from ships of YouTube vloggers and video gamers like Clay | Dream/GeorgeNotFound, Wilbur Soot &amp; TommyInnit, Wilbur Soot &amp; Technoblade &amp; TommyInnit &amp; Phil Watson | Philza, Dan Howell/Phil Lester. Although many of the YouTube RFP ships are M/M (23%), the great majority are “&amp;” ships or friendship stories (71%) — we’ll come back to that in a second.</p> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>Headline here</h3> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Let’s take a closer look at the top two fandoms: BTS and YouTube RPF. One group sings about wanting to “light it up like dynamite,” and the other builds Minecraft blocks of dynamite from sand and gunpowder. So… not much in common at first glance.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">But consider this, both fandoms come from cultures with rigid gender norms.</p> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">BTS is from South Korea, home to the largest gender wage gap of OECD member countries. The Washington Post’s Michelle Ye Hee Lee writes the country’s “deep-seated view of women’s role in society can be summed up in one Korean word: jib-saram, or “home person.” It’s a word for “wife.””</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">But the burden to conform to gender roles doesn’t stop with just women, men also must meet a certain stereotype of masculinity. In the 1990s, that was the Korean equivalent of a “finance bro,” a “salaryman” with expensive suits and luxury watches. But, K-pop has started to stretch and expand the country’s definition of what can be masculine. Enter K-pop inspired “flowerboys.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Dr. Sun Jung explained in BBC: "Compared to the 80s and 90s, now there are a lot more soft masculinities — pretty boy images and gentle male images — represented in media, and consumers welcome and widely consume them.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">The flowerboy softness is still decidedly not feminine though.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Jung continues: "I think the phenomenon should rather be explained through the notion of hybrid or versatile masculinity - soft yet manly at the same time - which is different from effeminised.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">But, this idea of expanding masculinity has its limits, especially when it comes to same-sex relationships. In a landmark ruling for LGBTQ+ rights, South Korea’s supreme court ruled in July 2024 that a same-sex partner was eligible for spousal benefits from the state health insurance. Despite this acknowledgement, the country, like much of Asia, has yet to legalize same-sex marriage or civil unions and lacks many protections other for queer people.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">By creating slash ships of some of the biggest K-pop stars, fanfic authors erase any sort of gender or power dynamic and challenge the current limits of masculinity.</p> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">And much of the same dynamics are at play with YouTube RPF:</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">A decade ago, the gaming community was forced to take stock of its toxic masculinity after Gamergate, a misogynistic online harassment campaign and a right-wing backlash against feminism, diversity, and progressivism in video game culture. The harassment spanned the gamut from “make me a sandwich” memes to death threats, but the message was clear: only cisgender straight white men belonged.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Not much has changed in the last 10 years. In 2023 a former Call of Duty champion — whose nickname is “Censor,” despite doing none of that — said a homophobic slur on his Twitch stream. He apologized. Then a week later he said the n-word.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">All of this in the name of “competitiveness.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">That’s why it’s so refreshing to see YouTuber bromances like Wilbur Soot &amp; TommyInnit or Ranboo &amp; Tubbo. Somehow, they’ve been able to subvert the “masculine stereotypes that make young men reluctant to open up emotionally and likely to assume a competitive distance from peers.” According to fanfic on Ao3, these friendships rank right up there with the likes of Marvel’s Peter Parker &amp; Tony Stark.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Because these types of unfiltered relationships between men are so rarely visible in the “real world,” fanfic authors jump on the chance to expand the intimacy, creating a fantasy blueprint of their hopes for reality, sometimes blurring the lines between friendship and romance.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">According to researchers at the University of Winchester, bromances and queer relationships are inherently linked:</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">“The more homophobic a society is, the more distant, stoic, and aggressive men become,” said Stefan Robinson, Ph.D. “For men’s friendships, this meant that self-disclosure and emotional openness—vital components for one’s emotional well-being—were completely lacking.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">You’d think this would have the video game community rushing to deal with its sexism, racism, and homophobia, but for now all of those problems just get reflected right back into the games produced and played, creating unjust and unbalanced worlds.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">In the 2010s, there were roughly 91,000 video games documented by the LGBTQ Video Game Archive, a project organized by Temple University’s Adrienne Shaw. But, only about 1% had any type of queer representation. And in the rare chance that a queer storyline was included, they were often treated like “side quests.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Writing fanfic about BTS and YouTube vloggers, is transformative work, turning the “side quest” into the “main quest,” where all of the swirling systemic, structural, and societal problems that plague your favorite real person can be erased with a flick of the wrist. You get to rewrite what everyone else got wrong.</p> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>Headline here</h3> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Slash fics about boy banders and blogger bros make up the majority of RPF, but that means that they are mostly non-canon — fanfics that pair seemingly straight people together in queer relationships.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">But when you look at just the canon RPF, another pattern emerges. The majority of the canon fanfic pairs openly queer people who are in real-life relationships with other openly queer people.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">That might not seem like much of a distinction — both get you M/M or F/F ships — but one creates more queer representation using ships that don’t exist in real life and the other amplifies already existing queer romances.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">One means you’re rewriting someone else’s reality, and the other means you might be rewriting your own.</p> </div><div class="hed svelte-1l991r9"><h3>Headline here</h3> </div><div class="prose svelte-1l991r9"><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Adding to all that psychological hypothesizing is the simple fact that people tend to write what they know, and these celebrities are VERY well known.

Harry Styles himself has a cumulative total of close to 100 million across Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">With all those eyes on you, it’s easy to think that having fanfiction penned about you should “come with the territory.”</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">But having fanfiction essentially leak out into the mainstream is still a bit uncharted.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">When Spockanalia, the first Star Trek fanzine, launched in 1967, people were writing about the future, but no one could predict the internet. Pre-internet, fanfic looked like Spockanalia: “somewhere around 20,000 copies” that sold for 50 cents a piece and were put together without a heavy duty stapler:</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">“It had 45 doubled-sided pages, and we did not own a heavy-duty stapler. We didn’t know there was such a thing. So, we were at the convention, in my bedroom we were doing this. We had a wall stapler, and we stapled it through the magazine, pried it off with a screwdriver, and somebody closed each prong of the wall staple with pliers, which is why if you have an original, first-printing copy, the staple will have started to cut through the paper because it has sharp edges, unlike a regular staple designed to staple paper together.” — Devra Langsam</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">fanfic (including Spockanalia) is at the fingertips of millions, and without you being stabbed by staples.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">And with increased visibility has come increasing ethical questions around real person fiction — you know it’s heated when the Wikipedia entry has a whole section devoted to pros and cons.</p><p class="svelte-1n3b99u">Like everything truly worth anything in the world there’s a spectrum.
